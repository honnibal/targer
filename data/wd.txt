My O

in O

I O
have O

my O

so O
if O

As O
of O
one O
day O
after O
Atlantic O
released O
its O
article O
reviewing O
The O
Public O
School O
Advantage O
: O
Why O

, O
a O

one O
article O
covering O
the O
important O
findings O
of O
authors O
Sarah O
Theule O
Lubienski O
and O
Christopher O
A O
Lubienski O
. O

The B-B
Lubienskis B-I
took B-I
into B-I
the B-I
account B-I
the B-I
effects B-I
of B-I
affluence B-I
, B-I
disabilities B-I
and B-I
other B-I
background B-I
factors B-I
and B-I
found B-I
that B-I
then B-I
public B-I
schools B-I
outperformed B-I
private B-I
schools B-I
over B-I
the B-I
past B-I
twenty B-I
years B-I
. B-I

According B-I
to B-I
Atlantic B-I
, B-I
the B-I
Lubienskis B-I
report B-I
that B-I
the B-I
Educational B-I
Testing B-I
Service B-I
, B-I
Stanford B-I
and B-I
Notre B-I
Dame B-I
all B-I
took B-I
a B-I
look B-I
at B-I
the B-I
same B-I
statistics B-I
— B-I
datasets B-I
they B-I
call B-I
it B-I
— B-I
and B-I
came B-I
to B-I
the B-I
same B-I
conclusions B-I
. B-I

The R-B
Lubienskis R-I
aren R-I
’ R-I
t R-I
saying R-I
that R-I
public R-I
school R-I
students R-I
score R-I
higher R-I
, R-I
because R-I
test R-I
comparisons R-I
show R-I
that R-I
the R-I
average R-I
private R-I
school R-I
student R-I
scores R-I
higher R-I
. R-I

But F-B
the F-I
private F-I
school F-I
student F-I
is F-I
likely F-I
to F-I
be F-I
wealthier F-I
, F-I
come F-I
from F-I
a F-I
stable F-I
family F-I
, F-I
not F-I
have F-I
a F-I
disability F-I
and F-I
not F-I
have F-I
suffered F-I
early F-I
life F-I
trauma F-I
. F-I

Correct O
for O
these O
factors O
— O
in O
a O
sense O
only O
compare O
apples O
that O
fell O
from O
the O
private O
school O
tree O
with O
those O
that O
fell O
from O
the O
public O
school O
tree O
— O
and O
the O
public O
school O
wins O
hands O
down O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
far O
from O
the O
crisis O
in O
public O
education O
that O
many O
see O
, O
the O
Lubienskis O
make O
a O
strong O
case O
that O
public O
school O
are O
doing O
a O
fine O
job O
educating O
the O
youth O
of O
America O
. O

The O
results O
of O
the O
study O
don O
’ O
t O
surprise O
me O
because O
I O
live O
in O
the O
real O
world O
, O
and O
in O
the O
real O
world O
the O
best O
get O
paid O
the O
most O
. O

Now O
I O
’ O
m O
not O
saying O
that O
Alex O
Rodriguez O
deserves O
to O
make O
more O
money O
than O
Miguel O
Cabrera O
, O
but O
that O
they O
and O
every O
other O
professional O
ball O

make O
a O
lot O
more O
money O
than O
minor O
leaguers O

in O
foreign O

The O

Public P-B
school P-I
teachers P-I
make P-I
more P-I
money P-I
than P-I
private P-I
school P-I
teachers P-I
. P-I

Doesn P-I
’ P-I
t P-I
it P-I
make P-I
sense P-I
that P-I
they P-I
would P-I
therefore P-I
do P-I
a P-I
better P-I
job P-I
and P-I
that P-I
public P-I
schools P-I
would P-I
therefore P-I
do P-I
better P-I
in P-I
quantitative P-I
comparisons P-I
? P-I

I O
know O
that O
there O
are O
some O
very O
competent O
and O
dedicated O
private O
school O
teachers O
, O
but O
in O
general O
, O
how O
could O
they O
outperform O
public O

teachers O
, O
who O
make O
so O
much O
more O
money O

Thus P-B
my P-I
lack P-I
of P-I
surprise P-I
to P-I
learn P-I
that P-I
public P-I

students P-I
outperform P-I
private P-I
school P-I
students P-I
on P-I
a P-I
level P-I
playing P-I
field P-I
and P-I
that P-I
public P-I
schools P-I

their P-I
teachers P-I
are P-I
more P-I
open P-I
to P-I
innovations P-I

trying P-I
new P-I

techniques P-I
. P-I

Nor O
was O
I O
surprised O
that O

ignored O
the O
Lubienski O
book O

One O
of O
the O
ideological O
tenets O
of O
the O
mass O
media O
is O
that O
the O
private O
sector O
always O
outperforms O
the O
public O
sector O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
education O
, O
it O
’ O
s O
just O
not O
so O
, O
but O
the O
news O
media O
filters O
out O
this O
important O
news O
for O
ideological O
reasons O
. O

The O
news O
media O
, O
owned O
as O
they O
are O
by O
large O
companies O
, O
have O
come O
to O
share O
big O
business O
’ O
disdain O
for O
unions O
, O
especially O
over O
the O
past O
thirty O
years O
. O

The O
news O
media O
will O
certainly O
give O
fair O
coverage O
to O
both O
sides O
of O
most O
labor O
disputes O
, O
but O
in O
feature O
coverage O
they O
give O
far O
greater O
voice O
to O
anti-union O
pundits O
, O
writers O
, O
politicians O
, O
theories O
and O
events O
than O
to O
those O
in O
support O
of O
unions O
. O

Weakening O
unions O
is O
one O
key O
strategy O
in O
the O
thirty-year O
class O
war O
in O
which O
wealth O
has O
been O
transferred O
from O
the O
middle O
class O
and O
poor O
up O
the O
economic O
ladder O
to O
the O
wealthy O
. O

Charter O
schools O
, O
vouchers O
for O
private O
schools O
, O
school O
and O
school O
district O
takeovers O
— O
virtually O
all O
right-wing O
school O
reform O
efforts O
attack O
public O
school O
teachers O
because O
they O
are O
unionized O
and O
therefore O
make O
a O
decent O
wage O
. O

As O
supporters O
of O
this O
campaign O
against O
public O
teachers O
unions O
, O
it O
only O
makes O
sense O

As O
a O
disabled O
person O
with O
an O
interest O
in O
politics O
, O
the O
conversation O
sometimes O
turns O
to O
education O
. O

More O
specifically O
whether O
mainstream O
education O
or O
‘ O
special O
’ O
education O
is O
better O
for O
disabled O
children O
. O

The O
media O
often O
frame O
the O
argument O
as O
one O
of O
“ O
integration O
” O
and O
“ O
segregation O
” O
. O

However O
, O
I O
personally O
feel O
that O
this O
is O
a O
gross O
oversimplification O
which O
sometimes O
leads O
those O
who O
proclaim O
to O
be O
allies O
of O
the O
disabled O
down O
risky O
paths O
. O

This O
was O
made O
clear O
to O
me O
last O
year O
when O
disabled O
charities O
advocated O
the O
closure O
of O
the O
Remploy O
factories O
on O
similar O
grounds O
. O

Although O
I O
accept O
that O
initial O
intentions O
can O
be O
noble O
, O
sometimes O
, O
the O
language O
of O
liberation O
can O
carry O
an O
unintended O
payload O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
outcome O
, O
far O
from O
being O
one O
of O
‘ O
liberation O
’ O
, O
can O
actually O
cement O
oppression O
, O
simply O
because O
the O
bigger O
picture O
hasn O
’ O
t O
been O
considered O
. O

As O
the O
temporary O
alliance O
between O
Liz O
Sayce O
and O
Maria O
Miller O
proves O
, O
this O
can O
make O
for O
some O
very O
unlikely O
bedfellows O
. O

In O
an O
ideal O
world O
, O
I O
would O
be O
in O
full O
support O
of O
such O
ideas O
but O
in O
reality O
, O
this O
issue O
is O
far O
more O
complex O
; O
embracing O
children O
with O
different O
requirements O
and O
potentials O
. O

I O
would O
argue O
that O
integration O
is O
an O
aspiration O
and O
not O
a O
prerequisite O
for O
ensuring O
the O
best O
education O
for O
disabled O
children O

Furthermore O
there O
is O
a O
distinct O
lack O
of O
disabled O
voices O

, O

‘ O
experts O
’ O
or O
proxy O
organization O
’ O

, O
such O
as O

Disabled O

for O

with O
such O
important O
arguments O

ultimately O

My O

not O

by O
any O

My O

condition O
to O
this O
day O
and O
like O
many O
disabled O

I O
was O

By O
no O
means O
is O
bullying O
exclusive O

That O
said O

it O
can O
pose O
an O
obstacle O

point O
rarely O

One O
of O
the O
benefits O
of O

benefits O
all O
children O
; O
class O
sizes O
are O
smaller O
ensuring O
a O
better O
teacher O
to O
pupil O
ratio O
. O

This O
means O
that O
teachers O
can O
spend O
more O
time O
on O
each O
pupil O
, O
answering O
any O
questions O
or O
concerns O
they O
may O
have O
about O
the O
tasks O
set O
. O

To O
my O
mind O
, O
this O
is O
not O
an O
issue O
with O
a O
quick O
fix O
solution O
, O
nor O
are O
there O
any O
definitive O
answers O
on O
what O
’ O
s O
better O
for O

. O

As O
I O
stated O
earlier O
, O
mainstream O
was O
the O
right O
move O
for O
me O
, O
however O
I O
do O
not O
regret O
my O
time O
spent O
in O
The O
Court O
. O

It O
provided O
me O
with O
the O
first O
steps O
in O
my O
education O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
it O
is O
almost O
certain O
that O
‘ O
special O
’ O
education O
will O
always O
be O
necessary O
for O
some O
school-students O
and O
ultimately O
it O
is O
their O
needs O
which O
should O
form O
the O
focus O
of O
this O
debate O
. O

To O
that O
end O
, O
the O
‘ O
integration O
vs O
. O
segregation O
’ O
argument O
simply O
becomes O
an O
argument O
that O
is O
abstract O
and O
separate O
from O
reality O
. O

So O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
all O
provision O
for O
disabled O
pupils O
( O
and O
students O
) O
needs O
defending O
whether O
its O
special O
schools O
, O
SEN O
( O
special O
education O
needs O
) O
departments O
in O
mainstream O
schools O
or O
learning O
support O
assistants O
. O

I O
hope O
disabled O
people O
, O

, O
teachers O
and O

can O
consider O
this O
possibility O
the O
next O

That O
afternoon O
I O
met O
Billy O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
walked O
in O
the O
door O
after O
school O
. O

“ O
I O

“ O
Out O
with O
it O
. O
” O

“ O
She O
kept O
chanting O
Namu O
Amida O
Butsu O
… O
” O

The O
following O
morning O
I O
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
principal O
in O
the O
school O
parking O
lot O
. O

“ O
Look O
, O
I O
don O
’ O
t O

my O
son O
praying O
to O
the O
Eternal O
Spirit O
of O

I O

him O

a O

“ O
What O
about O
Bertha O

? O
” O

“ O
Excellent O

” O

I O
could O
hardly O
wait O
to O
hear O
about O
Mrs O

Smith O
’ O
s O
prayer O

I O
was O
standing O
on O
the O
front O
steps O
of O
the O
school O
when O
the O
final O
bell O
rang O
. O

“ O
Well O
? O
” O

I O
asked O
Billy O
as O
we O
walked O
towards O
the O
car O
. O

“ O
Okay O
. O
” O

“ O
Okay O
what O
? O
” O

“ O
Mrs O
. O
Smith O
asked O
God O
to O
bless O
us O
and O
ended O
her O
prayer O
in O
Jesus O
’ O
name O
, O
amen O
just O
like O
you O

” O

I O
breathed O
a O
sigh O
of O
relief O
. O

“ O
Now O
we O
’ O
re O
getting O
some O
place O

” O

“ O
She O
even O
taught O
us O
a O
verse O
of O
scripture O
about O
prayer O
, O
” O
said O
Billy O
. O

I O
beamed O
. O

“ O
Wonderful O
. O

What O
was O
the O
verse O
? O
” O

“ O
Lets O
see O
… O
” O
he O
mused O
for O
a O
moment O
. O

“ O
And O
behold O
, O
they O
began O
to O
pray O
; O
and O
they O
did O
pray O
unto O
Jesus O
, O
calling O
him O
their O
Lord O
and O
their O
God O

” O

We O
had O
reached O
the O
car O
. O

“ O
Fantastic O
, O
” O
I O
said O
reaching O
for O
the O
door O
handle O
. O

Then O
paused O
. O

I O
couldn O
’ O
t O
place O
the O
scripture O
. O

“ O
Billy O
, O
did O
Mrs O

Smith O
say O
what O
book O
that O
verse O
was O
from O
? O
” O

“ O

18 O
. O
” O

“ O
Nephi O
what O

” O

“ O
Nephi O
, O
” O
he O
said O

“ O
It O
’ O

” O

The O
school O

In O
recent O
blogs O
, O
I O
’ O
ve O
been O
concerned O
with O
clearing O
up O
some O
common O
misconceptions O
relating O
to O
areas O
of O
interface O
( O
sometimes O
involving O
significant O
controversy O
and O
conflict O
) O
between O
religion O
and O
secular O
American O
culture O
. O

Having O
previously O
discussed O
why O
teaching O
creationism O
in O
public O
school O
science O
classes O
, O
or O
posting O
the O
Ten O
Commandments O
in O
public O
school O
classrooms O
, O
are O
both O
inappropriate O
and O
unconstitutional O
, O
I O
suppose O
it O
’ O
s O
perhaps O
time O
now O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
whole O
heated O
issue O
of O
the O
place O
of O
prayer O
in O
U O
. O
S O
. O
public O
schools O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
heated O
rhetoric O
in O
the O
air O
these O
days O
regarding O
an O
alleged O
ban O
on O
prayer O
in O
the O
public O
schools O
. O

A O
number O
of O
conservative O
Christian O
leaders O
frequently O
complain O
about O
the O
tragic O
injustice O
of O
how O
kids O
aren O
’ O
t O
allowed O
to O
pray O
in O
school O
anymore O
. O

This O
is O
nonsense O
. O

Kids O
pray O
all O
the O
time O
in O
school O
( O
often O
right O
before O
a O
quiz O
or O
exam O
) O
. O

In P-B
fact P-I
, P-I
the P-I
Bill P-I
of P-I
Rights P-I
’ P-I
First P-I
Amendment P-I
protects P-I
both P-I
the P-I
right P-I
to P-I
freedom P-I
of P-I
speech P-I
( P-I
prayer P-I
can P-I
obviously P-I
be P-I
a P-I
form P-I
of P-I
speech P-I
) P-I
as P-I
well P-I
as P-I
the P-I
right P-I
to P-I
free P-I
exercise P-I
of P-I
religion P-I
( P-I
praying P-I
also P-I
obviously P-I
qualifies P-I
as P-I
exercising P-I
one P-I
’ P-I
s P-I
religion P-I
) P-I
. P-I

So P-I
, P-I
the P-I
right P-I
of P-I
kids P-I
to P-I
pray P-I
in P-I
school P-I
is P-I
not P-I
only P-I
not P-I
banned P-I
, P-I
but P-I
even P-I
constitutionally P-I
protected P-I
. P-I

And O
, O
in O
actual O
fact O
, O
no O
one O
is O
officially O
disallowing O
kids O
to O
pray O
in O
school O
whenever O
they O
want O
( O
so O
long O
as O
it O
isn O
’ O
t O
disruptive O

of O
course O
— O
a O
basic O
school O
rule O
that O
equally O
applies O
to O
other O
sorts O
of O
free O
speech O
and O
forms O
of O
self-expression O
) O
. O

However O
, O
please O
note O
that O
these O
constitutionally O
protected O
legal O
rights O
and O
freedoms O
apply O
only O
to O
people O

not O
to O

and O
give O
free O
expression O
to O
their O
own O

however O
, O
the O
state O
cannot O
do O
likewise O
( O

the O
U O

that O
the O

not O

“ O

The P-B

public P-I
schools P-I

government-run P-I

taxpayer-supported P-I

are P-I
part P-I
of P-I
“ P-I

( P-I

the P-I

an O
“ O

support O
, O
on O
an O
official O
basis O
, O
by O
the O
state O
— O
which O
is O
flatly O
unconstitutional O
) O
. O

Private C-B
individuals C-I
can C-I
pray C-I
whenever C-I
and C-I
wherever C-I
they C-I
want C-I
; C-I
no C-I

s C-I
personal C-I
freedoms C-I
are C-I

But C-I
the C-I
state C-I
( C-I

cannot C-I
mandate C-I

It O
really O
is O
that O
simple O
. O

It O
is O
sometimes O
objected O
that O
teachers O
’ O
rights O
of O
religious O
expression O
and O
free O
speech O
are O
being O
violated O
, O
if O
they O
are O
forbidden O
to O
lead O
students O
in O
prayer O
. O

However O
, O
teachers O
on O
duty O
in O
public O
schools O
are O
not O
acting O
as O
private O
individuals O
, O
but O
as O
employees O
( O
and O
hence O
representatives O
) O
of O
the O
state O
. O

While O
acting O
in O
their O
capacity O
as O
employees O
of O
the O
state O
, O
public O
school O
teachers O
must O
comply O
by O
the O
constitutional O
rules O
that O
prevent O
the O
state O
from O
endorsing O
or O
promoting O
religion O
. O

( O
That O
also O
means O
that O
public O
school O
teachers O
may O
not O
post O
the O
Ten O
Commandments O
in O
their O
classrooms O
, O
or O
teach O
creationism O
in O
science O
classes O
, O
since O
doing O
so O
amounts O
to O
just O
as O
much O
of O
an O
unconstitutional O
state O
endorsement O
or O
promotion O
of O
religion O
as O
does O
leading O
students O
in O
classroom O
prayers O
. O
) O

So O
, O
schools O
are O
by O
no O
means O
“ O
prayer O
free O
zones O
” O
— O
the O
shrill O
objections O
of O
ultra-conservative O
Christians O
committed O
to O
the O
unconstitutional O
re-introduction O
of O
state-sanctioned O
, O
teacher-led O
daily O
school O
prayer O
notwithstanding O
. O

Just O
because O
school O
officials O
may O
not O
lead O
students O
in O
prayers O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
students O
are O
unable O
to O
freely O
pray O
on O
their O
own O
, O
throughout O
the O
day O
, O
at O
school O
. O

Students O
can O
( O
and O
do O
) O
. O

In O
the O
wake O
of O
violent O
school-related O
tragedies O
, O
such O
as O
the O
recent O
massacre O
at O
a O
Newtown O
, O
Connecticut O
public O
elementary O
school O
, O
there O
is O
often O
a O
wave O
of O
heated O
rhetoric O
emanating O
from O
religious O
conservatives O
regarding O
how O
perhaps O
such O
school O
shootings O
might O
not O
have O
occurred O
if O
only O
we O
had O
not O
“ O
kicked O
God O
out O
of O
our O
schools O
” O
by O
banning O
state-led O
school O
prayer O
. O

But O
such O
reasoning O
is O
deeply O
flawed O
and O
fallacious O
on O
multiple O
levels O
. O

Firstly O
, O
we O
have O
not O
“ O
kicked O
God O
out O
of O
our O
schools O
. O
” O

As O
private O
individuals O
, O
kids O
today O
remain O
as O
free O
to O
pray O
in O
their O
schools O
as O
they O
have O
ever O
been O
; O
in O
fact O
, O
their O
right O
to O
do O
so O
is O
constitutionally O
protected O
. O

It O
’ O
s O
just O
that O
it O
has O
been O
widely O
recognized O
that O
it O
is O
clearly O
unconstitutional O
for O
the O
state O
( O
and O
, O
by O
extension O
, O
state O
schools O
) O
to O
officially O
sanction O
, O
sponsor O
, O
offer O
, O
or O
conduct O
prayers O
. O

That O
in O
itself O
clearly O
does O
not O
transform O
schools O
into O
“ O
God-free O
zones O
” O
; O
banning O
schools O
from O
leading O
prayers O
, O
like O
banning O
schools O
from O
teaching O
religious O
doctrines O
such O
as O
creationism O
or O
posting O
religious O
rules O
such O
as O
the O
Ten O
Commandments O
, O
merely O
ensures O
that O
public O
schools O
remain O
religiously O
neutral O
environments O
, O
for O
students O
of O
every O
religion O
or O
no O
religion O
. O

Secondly O
, O
banning O
school O
prayer O
can O
in O
no O
way O
be O
seen O
as O
somehow O
rejecting O
or O
abandoning O
the O
alleged O
divine O
protection O
that O
schools O
would O
otherwise O
enjoy O
, O
as O
such O
theological O
criticisms O
always O
seem O
to O
intend O
to O
imply O
. O

Officially P-B
implementing P-I
mandatory P-I
school P-I
prayers P-I
in P-I
no P-I
way P-I
offers P-I
a P-I
divine P-I
guarantee P-I
against P-I
school P-I
shootings P-I
from P-I
occurring P-I
. P-I

For B-B
proof B-I
of B-I
this B-I
, B-I
all B-I
one B-I
need B-I
do B-I
is B-I
to B-I
recall B-I
the B-I
2006 B-I
shooting B-I
spree B-I
which B-I
occurred B-I
in B-I
an B-I

Ten B-I
girls B-I
were B-I
shot B-I
; B-I
five B-I
of B-I
them B-I
died B-I

And B-I
this B-I
tragedy B-I
occurred B-I
despite B-I
the B-I
fact B-I
that B-I

Homeschooling R-B

to R-I
move R-I

pace R-I

yet O
it F-B

While O

reasons O
that O

not O

to O
pursue O
this O

option O

This O
large O

no P-I
laid P-I
out P-I
plans P-I

homeschooling P-I
can P-I

a P-I
great P-I

of P-I
work P-I
for P-I
parents P-I

and P-I
occasionally P-I
confusing P-I

they P-I

in B-I
no B-I
way B-I
" B-I
Wealthy B-I

however B-I
I B-I
chose B-I
to B-I
send B-I
my B-I
children B-I
to B-I
private B-I
school B-I
that B-I
has B-I
a B-I
religion B-I
based B-I
background B-I
. B-I

Our P-B
schools P-I
are P-I
taking P-I
God P-I
out P-I
of P-I
the P-I
schools P-I
and P-I
that P-I
is P-I
my P-I
main P-I
deciding P-I
factor P-I
. P-I

I P-I
am P-I
involved P-I
as P-I
a P-I
parent P-I
, P-I
why P-I
is P-I
it P-I
that P-I
we P-I
have P-I
religion P-I
in P-I
Jails P-I
but P-I
not P-I
in P-I
the P-I
public P-I
school P-I
system P-I

And O
I O
think O
its O
every O
parents O
right O
to O
chose O
to O
educate O
their O
child O
as O
they O
see O
fit O
. O

The P-B
curriculum P-I
is P-I
much P-I
more P-I
hands P-I
on P-I
and P-I
students P-I
learn P-I
more P-I
. P-I

They P-I
could P-I
do P-I
this P-I
at P-I

do P-I
not P-I

So O
I O
think O
your O
argument O
needs O
a O

more O

facts O

Seems O
to O
me O
that O
you O
would O
send O
your O

if O
you O

you O
had O
the O

Where O
there O

a O

there O
is O
a O
way O

There O
are O
grants O

If O
the O

find O

I O

at O

These P-B

have P-I
spoken P-I
about P-I

the P-I
extra P-I
resources P-I
available P-I
at P-I
the P-I

there P-I

? O

From P-B
my P-I
school P-I
experience P-I
, P-I
public P-I
schools P-I
offered P-I
more P-I
diversity P-I
socially P-I
, P-I
spiritually P-I
and P-I
ethnically P-I
, P-I
so P-I
I P-I
think P-I
it P-I
provided P-I
a P-I
more P-I

view P-I
of P-I
the P-I

I P-I
would P-I
face P-I

On P-B
the P-I
other P-I
hand P-I
, P-I
when P-I
your P-I

in P-I
a P-I
particular P-I
area P-I
, P-I
such P-I
as P-I
music P-I

or P-I
you P-I
want P-I
your P-I
child P-I
to P-I
have P-I
a P-I
spiritual P-I
education P-I
, P-I
it P-I
might P-I
be P-I
worth P-I
considering P-I
schools P-I
that P-I
have P-I
a P-I
curriculum P-I
focusing P-I
on P-I
those P-I

When O

a O

others O
sent O

Then P-B
there P-I

with P-I
voluntary P-I
annual P-I
fees P-I
at P-I
around P-I
several P-I

Debate P-I
constantly P-I
rages P-I
about P-I

issue P-I

our P-I

When O
all O
the O
evidence O
for O
public O
and O
private O
schooling O
is O
boiled O
down O
, O
I O
think O
the O
most O

factors O
are O
sending O
your O

to O
a O
school O
where O
they O
are O
safe O
, O

will O
receive O
a O

There O
are O
schools O
in O
both O
the O
public O

private O
systems O
where O
these O
factors O
are O
paramount O
, O
so O
it O
is O
up O
to O
us O

find O
the O

that O
ticks O

many O

Socialization O
One R-B
of R-I
the R-I

arguments R-I

that R-I

it R-I

six R-I
hours R-I

every R-I
day R-I
with R-I
same-age R-I

many F-B
homeschooled F-I
children F-I

activities F-I

All F-I
of F-I
these F-I
situations F-I

skills F-I

Some R-B

that R-I

not R-I

the R-I
breadth R-I

curriculum R-I
that R-I
children R-I
receive R-I
in R-I
school R-I

Homeschoolers R-I

study R-I
the R-I
same R-I
topics R-I

peers R-I

However F-B
, F-I
the F-I
flexibility F-I
provided F-I
by F-I
the F-I
homeschool F-I
lifestyle F-I
may F-I
allow F-I
students F-I

other F-I
areas F-I
such F-I
as F-I

or F-I

Students F-I

in F-I
the F-I
areas F-I
most F-I

their F-I

Strengthening O

A R-B
final R-I
argument R-I
that R-I

most F-I

families F-I
do F-I

live F-I
in F-I
isolation F-I

In F-I
fact F-I

point F-I

I B-B

I B-I
have B-I

mainstreamed B-I

six P-I

put P-I

that P-I

I P-B
personally P-I

like P-I
these P-I
kids P-I
are P-I
shortchanged- P-I
some P-I
of P-I
them P-I
are P-I
good P-I
kids P-I
who P-I
need P-I
an P-I
adult P-I
close P-I

able P-I
to P-I
give P-I
more P-I
focused P-I
attention P-I

In P-I
a P-I
class P-I
of P-I
30+ P-I
, P-I
this P-I
isn P-I
' P-I
t P-I
going P-I

And P-B
some P-I

little P-I

no P-I

I P-I

not P-I
allowed P-I

a P-I

That P-I
impairs P-I
my P-I

Also P-B
, P-I
some P-I
have P-I
so P-I
many P-I
modifications P-I
that P-I
for P-I
all P-I
intents P-I

purposes P-I
they P-I
are P-I
merely P-I
taking P-I

a B-I

I B-I

I O
' O

Most O
of O
the O

the O

I P-B

Children P-I

that P-I

all P-I

in B-I
four B-I

I B-I
only B-I

There B-I

This B-I

I B-I
left B-I

woefully B-I
unprepared B-I
for B-I
college B-I
, B-I
and B-I
without B-I
that B-I
preparation B-I

I B-I
left B-I

your B-I
child B-I

who B-I

out O
a O

Once P-B

what P-I
I P-I
’ P-I

sure P-I

the P-I

I P-I
sat P-I

Yes O

there O
were O
some O
quite O
handsome O
ones O
that O
my O
eye O
would O
wander O
to O
in O

but O
not O
enough O
to O
distract O
me O
from O
my O
work O

have O
me O
expelled O

end O
up O

in P-I
a P-I

I P-B
really P-I
felt P-I
if P-I
I P-I
had P-I
stayed P-I

I P-I
would P-I
have P-I
been P-I
unprepared P-I
for P-I
life P-I
after P-I
high P-I
school P-I
, P-I
socially P-I
speaking P-I
. P-I

I O
wasn O
’ O
t O
going O
to O
an O
all-women O
’ O

college O
, O
and O
how O
many O
jobs O
are O
there O
where O
there O
are O
strictly O

in O
the O

? O

Being O
Jewish O
, O

wasn O
’ O

really O
an O
option O

Having P-B
spent P-I
middle P-I
school P-I
– P-I
those P-I
really P-I
developmental P-I
years P-I
, P-I
around P-I
very P-I
few P-I
boys P-I
– P-I
talking P-I
to P-I
them P-I
became P-I
a P-I
major P-I
cause P-I
of P-I
stress P-I
. P-I

I P-I
clammed P-I
up P-I
and P-I
couldn P-I
’ P-I
t P-I
put P-I
a P-I
sentence P-I
together P-I
. P-I

I P-I
later P-I
learned P-I
that P-I
I P-I
came P-I
off P-I
as P-I
a P-I
combination P-I
of P-I
snobby P-I
, P-I
shy P-I
and P-I
rude P-I
– P-I
simply P-I
because P-I
I P-I
hadn P-I
’ P-I
t P-I
spent P-I
enough P-I
time P-I
in P-I
social P-I
situations P-I
or P-I
just P-I
being P-I
around P-I
the P-I
opposite P-I
sex P-I
, P-I
and P-I
I P-I
had P-I
no P-I
idea P-I
how P-I
to P-I
talk P-I
to P-I
them P-I
! P-I

Switching O
schools O
changed O
that O
all O
for O
the O
better O
. O

I O
love O
my O
guy O
friends O
; O
they O
have O
made O
me O
a O
die-hard O
Lakers O
fan O
, O
and O
I O
appreciate O
them O
just O
as O
much O
as O
my O
closest O
girlfriends O
. O

Everyone O
needs O
a O
mix O
in O
their O
close-knit O
friend O
group O
. O

The P-B
cattiness P-I
, P-I
hierarchy P-I
and P-I
estrogen P-I
rages P-I
became P-I
a P-I
whole P-I
other P-I
issue P-I
. P-I

The P-I
cliques P-I
and P-I
gossip P-I
were P-I
unbearable P-I
. P-I

Upon O
leaving O
my O
all O
girls O
school O
, O
I O
learned O
that O
someone O
there O
had O
told O
people O
I O
left O
due O
to O
a O
heroin O
addiction O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
WHAT O
IN O
THE O
WORLD O
? O
! O

I O
actually O
had O
to O
go O
down O
there O
one O
day O
, O
find O
the O
culprit O
and O
set O
the O
record O
straight O
. O

I O
was O
sent O
on O
a O
wild O
goose O
chase O
from O
clique O
to O
clique O
. O

When O
I O
eventually O
found O
her O
, O
she O
gave O
me O
a O
snobby O
and O
unapologetic O
, O
“ O
Sorry O
, O
are O
we O
done O
here O
? O
” O
, O
swiveled O
on O
her O
pink O
Converse O
and O
strutted O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction O
. O

There O
was O
to O
be O
no O
cross-contamination O
between O
groups O
; O
you O
had O
to O
choose O
your O
friends O
or O
the O
queen O
bees O
would O
choose O
for O
you O
. O

Really O
, O
it O
was O
like O
Mean O
Girls O

We O
had O
a O
Regina O
George O
, O
Gretchen O
Wieners O
, O
Karen O
Smith O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
a O
Cady O
Heron O
. O

Just P-B
because P-I
we P-I
had P-I
a P-I
strict P-I
uniform P-I
, P-I
by P-I
no P-I
means P-I
did P-I
that P-I
mean P-I
there P-I
wasn P-I
’ P-I
t P-I
competition P-I
wardrobe-wise P-I
. P-I

Who P-I
makes P-I
your P-I
sneakers P-I
? P-I

Purse P-I
? P-I

Jewelry P-I
? P-I

Which P-I
uniform P-I
style P-I
are P-I
YOU P-I
wearing P-I
? P-I

Anyone P-I
who P-I
was P-I
anybody P-I
carried P-I
their P-I
books P-I
in P-I
a P-I
Dylan P-I
’ P-I

Candy P-I
Bar P-I
tote P-I
, P-I
then P-I
of P-I
course P-I
the P-I
accusations P-I
would P-I
fly P-I
about P-I
who P-I
really P-I
started P-I
the P-I
trend P-I
and P-I
who P-I
was P-I
copying P-I
whom P-I
. P-I

EVERYONE P-I
had P-I
the P-I
same P-I
one P-I

All-estrogen P-I
environments P-I
at P-I
that P-I
age P-I
thrive P-I

oneself P-I
seem P-I
holier-than-thou P-I
to P-I
at P-I

a P-I
few P-I
girls P-I
. P-I

Of O
course O
, O
it O
all O
really O
depends O
on O
the O
person O
. O

I O
reached O
out O
to O
some O
of O
the O
girls O
that O
I O
have O
remained O
very O
close O
with O
, O
and O
their O
opinions O
differ O
from O
mine O
quite O
a O

Olivia O

My O

Olivia O

as O
sweet O
as O
can O
be O

She O
always O
has O
the O
best O
advice O
, O
no O

the O
topic O
, O
and O
was O
so O
happy O
that O
I O
inquired O
about O
her O
opinion O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
our O
education O
. O

Overall R-B
, R-I
she R-I
was R-I
happy R-I
with R-I
the R-I
all-girls R-I
experience R-I
, R-I
thinking R-I
maybe R-I
four R-I
years R-I
would R-I
have R-I
been R-I
a R-I
little R-I
better R-I
than R-I
six R-I

but R-I
self-discovery R-I
was R-I
her R-I
biggest R-I
gain R-I
out R-I
of R-I
the R-I
school R-I
. R-I

When R-I
I R-I
asked R-I
her R-I
about R-I
it R-I

she R-I

While O
the O
debate O
goes O
on O
about O
the O
legitimacy O
of O
single-sex O
classes O
and O
schools O
in O
the O
public O
sector O
, O
private O
and O
independent O
schools O
keep O
taking O
the O
concept O
to O
whole O
new O
levels O
. O

Once O
upon O
a O
time O
coeducation O
was O
unthinkable O
. O

Boys O
were O
beastly O
enough O
without O
the O
distraction O
of O
girls O
, O
and O
the O
educational O
needs O
of O
girls O
were O
thought O
to O
diverge O
from O
those O
of O
boys O
even O
before O
puberty O
brought O
its O
complications O
. O

Early O
advocates O
of O
coeducation O
like O
Bronson O
Alcott O
were O
thought O
to O
be O
batty O
. O

Plenty O
of O
progressive O
educators O
and O
theorists O
have O
since O
laid O
to O
rest O
most O
of O
the O
traditional O
concerns O
and O
fears O
of O
coeducation O
skeptics O
. O

Public O
schools O
have O
been O
coed O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
and O
old O
schoolhouses O
with O
separate O
" O
Boys O
" O
and O
" O
Girls O
" O
entrances O
are O
quaint O
in O
a O
way O
that O
makes O
us O
shake O
our O
heads O
. O

As B-B
a B-I
kid B-I
I B-I
experienced B-I
both B-I
single-sex B-I
and B-I
coeducational B-I
schools B-I
. B-I

My B-I
public B-I
elementary B-I
school B-I
was B-I
coed B-I
, B-I
of B-I
course B-I
, B-I
and B-I
then B-I
I B-I
had B-I
six B-I
years B-I
of B-I
boys-only B-I
junior B-I
and B-I
senior B-I
high B-I
school B-I
. B-I

Then O
followed O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
of O
all-male O
university O
, O
until O
we O
were O
happily O
rolled O
over O
by O
the O
tidal O
wave O
of O
vintage O
1970 O
coeducation O
, O
leaving O
the O
president O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
keep O
his O
promise O
that O
we O
' O
d O
produce O
" O
a O
thousand O
male O
leaders O
" O
every O
year O
; O
so O
was O
born O
the O
cramped O
room O
students O
call O
a O
" O
forced O
triple O
. O
" O

As O
at O
many O
all-male O
institutions O
, O
the O
arrival O
of O
women O
didn O
' O
t O
make O
a O
huge O
dent O
in O
the O
culture O
right O
away O
, O
and O
so O
it O
when O
I O
found O
myself O
the O
lone O
male O
at O
a O
girls O
' O
summer O
camp O
( O
the O
maintenance O
guy O
, O
often O
reeking O
slightly O
of O
rotting O
garbage O
) O
I O
experienced O
culture O
shock O
. O

I O
had O
never O
really O
thought O
what O
it O
might O
be O
like O
to O
work O
in O
an O
all-female O
environment O
, O
stuck O
firmly O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
ladder O
, O
and O
so O
my O
summers O
there O
were O
a O
revelation O
. O

Not O
the O
least O
part O
of O
the O
revelation O
involved O
my O
discovery O
that O
the O
young O
leaders O
of O
the O
camp O
, O
members O
of O
the O
first O
generation O
of O
late-20th-century O
feminists O
, O
were O
pretty O
serious O
about O
using O
the O
camp O
experience--sailing O
, O
biking O
, O
swimming O
, O
and O
lots O
of O
group O
activities--as O
leadership O
development O
. O

I O
also O
learned O
the O
hard O
way O
not O
to O
step O
into O
problem-solving O
roles O
until O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
that O
younger O
campers O
idolized O
the O
competence O
of O
their O
counselors O
as O
much O
as O
they O
loved O
their O
warmth O
and O
enthusiasm O
. O

The O
task O
of O
female O
role O
models O
and O
mentors O
was O
changing O
, O
and O
the O
staff O
was O
up O
to O
the O
work O
. O

I O
also O
discovered O
what O
" O
collaborative O
leadership O
" O
meant O
, O
as O
the O
administrative O
staff--led O
by O
a O
superb O
director O
not O
long O
out O
of O
college O
herself--talked O
things O
over O
and O
made O
decisions O
in O
ways O
that O
sounded O
way O
more O
like O
what O
Chris O
Argyris O
had O
been O
talking O
about O
in O
his O
myth-shattering O
Organizational O
Behavior O
course O
that O
year O
than O
the O
autocratic O
, O
just-follow-me O
style O
I O
had O
imbibed O
from O
television O
, O
movies O
, O
and O
high O
school O
. O

If O
summers O
found O
me O
in O
a O
land O
of O
strong O
and O
independent O
women O
, O
my O
first O
three O
teaching O
jobs O
( O
my O
fourth O
has O
been O
in O
a O
decidedly O
coed O
environment O
) O
were O
back O
in O
a O
man O
' O
s O
world O
. O

I O
think O
many O
of O
my O
generation O
of O
male O
teachers O
, O
with O
varying O
experiences O
navigating O
the O
waters O
of O
what O
the O
news O
magazines O
assured O
us O
was O
a O
Feminist O
Revolution O
, O
had O
been O
chastened O
more O
than O
a O
little O
on O
the O
meaning O
of O
masculinity O
and O
manhood O
, O
and O
so O
we O
did O
our O
best O
to O
tame O
our O
little O
corners O
of O
school O
environments O
that O
occasionally O
evoked O
Lord O
of O
the O
Flies O
; O
gently O
mocked O
as O
Sensitive O
New O
Age O
Guys O
, O
we O
tried O
to O
help O
our O
male O
students O
exchange O
bluster O
and O
boisterousness O
for O
an O
occasional O
listen O
and O
maybe O
even O
the O
occasional O
tear O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
how O
well O
it O
worked O
, O
but O
we O
felt O
we O
were O
doing O
our O
small O
part O
to O
win O
obscure O
battles O
in O
the O
most O
remote O
fields O
of O
that O
revolution O
. O

In O
2013 O
, O
the O
world O
is O
decidedly O
different O
, O
and O
the O
battles O
are O
far O
less O
obscure O
. O

Colleges O
wrestle O
explicitly O
with O
how O
to O
combat O
" O
rape O
culture O
, O
" O
and O
events O
like O
the O
Steubenville O
trial O
generate O
national O
conversations O
around O
how O
our O
society O
fosters O
gender-role O
development O
. O

We O
celebrate O
the O
suddenly O
disproportionate O
success O
of O
girls O
in O
the O
conventional O
academic O
realm O
( O
they O
do O
so O
much O
better O
in O
high O
school O
that O
they O
disadvantage O
one O
another O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
competitive O
college O
admission O
) O
while O
we O
wonder O
whether O
one O
of O
our O
unending O
culture O
wars O
is O
on O
boys O
. O

Most O
boys O
' O
schools O
have O
long O
since O
stopped O
selling O
themselves O
as O
bastions O
of O
male O
hegemony O
and O
cut-it-with-a-knife O
testosterone O
culture O
. O

Curricula O
increasingly O
include O
diverse O
viewpoints O
, O
and O
access O
to O
self O
and O
creativity O
are O
as O
much O
a O
part O
of O
boys O
' O
school O
programs O
as O
lacrosse O
and O
basketball O
; O
schools O
work O
hard O
to O
imbue O
students O
with O
more O
beneficent O
ideas O
of O
what O
it O
means O
to O
be O
male O
, O
with O
responsibilities O
and O
difference O
equal O
parts O
of O
the O
equation O
. O

Education O
for O
boys O
and O
young O
men O
is O
changing O
, O
and O
it O
' O
s O
heartening O
, O
for O
example O
, O
to O
note O
that O
old-fashioned O
expressions O
of O
stereotypical O
maleness O
, O
like O
those O
caught O
on O
tape O
when O
Rutgers O
coach O
Mike O
Rice O
went O
off O
on O
his O
players O
, O
excite O
general O
shock O
and O
outrage O
. O

I O
just O
spent O
the O
better O
part O
of O
a O
day O
with O
the O
faculty O
of O
the O
all-girls O
Ellis O
School O
in O
Pittsburgh O
, O
where O
I O
was O
reminded O
of O
all O
the O
best O
aspects O
of O
my O
own O
education O
around O
gender O
and O
gender O
roles O
. O

Intentionally O
and O
explicitly O
working O
to O
turn O
out O
strong O

capable O
, O
assertive O
women O
, O
Ellis--its O
heritage O

its O

its O
visionary O
leadership--is O
all O
about O
helping O
girls O
find O
and O
build O
on O
their O
strengths O
and O
passions O
. O

Ellis O
makes O
no O
apologies O
for O
its O
commitment O
to O
the O
growth O
of O
girls O
and O
young O
women O
as O
a O
single-sex O

, O
and O
its O
palpable O
ethos O

me O
wishing O

rather O
to O
some O

I O

Somebody O
needs O
to O

I O
am O
sick O
and O
tired O
of O
reading O
diatribes O
against O
homeschooling O
from O
those O
who O
have O
never O
homeschooled O

don O

simply O
have O
a O
bias O
against O

, O
if O
I O
hear O

as O

I O

So O
why O

system O
of O
our O

when P-I

Here O
are O
the O
facts O

And O
I O
do O
mean O
facts O
: O
Homeschooled P-B
children P-I
significantly P-I
outperform P-I
children P-I
educated P-I
in P-I
public P-I
school P-I
systems P-I
in P-I

social P-I

Homeschooled P-I
children P-I
’ P-I

not P-I
significantly P-I
affected P-I

household P-I

or P-I
whether P-I
their P-I

Homeschooled P-I
children P-I
perform P-I
better P-I
overall P-I
in P-I
college P-I

from P-I
their P-I
freshman P-I
years P-I

their P-I

And O
want O
one O
more O
fact O
that O
may O
surprise O
you O
? O

Homeschooled P-B
children P-I
do P-I
not P-I
lag P-I
behind P-I
public P-I
school P-I
children P-I
overall P-I
in P-I
communication P-I

Full B-B
disclosure B-I
: B-I
my B-I
wife B-I
and B-I
I B-I
homeschooled B-I
our B-I
four B-I
children B-I
through B-I
eighth B-I
grade B-I
, B-I
and B-I
then B-I
used B-I
a B-I
mixture B-I
of B-I
private B-I
Christian B-I
high B-I
school B-I
and B-I
additional B-I
homeschooling B-I
throughout B-I
their B-I
high B-I
school B-I
years B-I
. B-I

But O
that O
’ O
s O
not O
what O
drives O
this O
for O
me O
. O

I O
am O
not O
one O
who O
needs O
others O
to O
make O
the O
choices O
I O
made O
to O
feel O
better O
about O
myself O
. O

And O
it O
’ O
s O
not O
even O
the O
superior O
academics O
. O

So O
why O
am O
I O
such O
an O
advocate O
? O

Because P-B
homeschooling P-I
is P-I
what P-I
lets P-I
you P-I
guard P-I
and P-I
protect P-I
your P-I
child P-I
’ P-I
s P-I
heart P-I
and P-I

mold P-I
their P-I
character P-I
in P-I
a P-I
dark P-I
and P-I
fallen P-I
world P-I
. P-I

I O
cannot O
say O
this O
strongly O
enough O
. O

I O
hope O
and O
pray O
and O
that O
every O
parent O
will O
consider O
homeschooling O
their O
child O
at O
least O
through O
the O
most O
pivotal O
years O
, O
which O
to O
my O
thinking O
, O
is O
late O
elementary O
and O
middle O
school O
years O
. O

It P-B
’ P-I
s P-I
what P-I
allows P-I
you P-I
to P-I
optimally P-I
shape P-I
their P-I
spiritual P-I
life P-I
, P-I
and P-I
pour P-I
into P-I
it P-I
without P-I
contest P-I
during P-I
those P-I
years P-I
when P-I
there P-I
should P-I
be P-I
no P-I
contest P-I
. P-I

It P-B
’ P-I
s P-I
what P-I
lets P-I
you P-I
insulate P-I
them P-I
from P-I
the P-I
world P-I
before P-I
their P-I
maturity P-I
is P-I
ready P-I
to P-I
engage P-I
it P-I
on P-I
their P-I
own P-I
. P-I

It P-B
’ P-I
s P-I
what P-I
lets P-I
you P-I
pick P-I
their P-I
friends P-I
and P-I
control P-I
the P-I
nature P-I
, P-I
speed P-I
and P-I

of P-I
their P-I
broader P-I

We P-B

Our P-I

I R-B
do R-I
not R-I

homeschooling R-I

the R-I

economic R-I

someone O

But O
even O
if O
there O
was O
a O

don O

I O
know O
so O
many O
of O
you O
strive O
to O
bring O

It O
’ O
s O
a O
difficult O

to O
advocate O
for O
what O
you O
feel O
may O
be O
the O
best O
for O
a O
child O
without O
unduly O
demeaning O
the O
good O

done O
in O

But O
because O
there O

Inclusion O

where O
all O

has O
been O

The O

there P-I

As O
previously O
mentioned O
in O
my O
last O
blog O
( O
Weekly O
reflection O
2 O
) O
I O
was O
working O
individually O
with O
a O
child O
with O
significant O
learning O
difficulties O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
would O
add O
this O
piece O
in O
to O
help O
develop O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
difficulties O
one O
child O
has O
and O
the O
significant O
disadvantage O
he O
has O
academically O
. O

He O
spends O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
out O
of O
class O
with O
the O
special O
education O
teachers O
receiving O
one O
on O
one O
work O
but O
missing O
out O
on O
other O
important O
activities O
. O

What O
I O
did O
notice O
whilst O
I O
was O
working O
with O
him O
was O
that O
at O
first O
he O
had O
absolutely O
no O
idea O
of O
what O
to O
write O
and O
me O
not O
knowing O
the O
movie O
did O
not O
help O
either O
but O
once O
I O
asked O
him O
to O
retell O
me O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
movie O
and O
started O
giving O
him O
some O
ideas O
he O
thought O
of O
his O
own O
and O
from O
there O
had O
some O
great O
ideas O
. O

However O
, O
he O
had O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
start O
the O
beginning O
of O
his O
narrative O
and O
what O
the O
structure O
of O
a O
narrative O
is O
, O
with O
the O
orientation O
beginning O
the O
narrative O
and O
the O
complication O
following O
. O

He O
wanted O
all O
the O
action O
to O
start O
at O
the O
beginning O
and O
with O
all O
his O
ideas O
the O
characters O
were O
being O
sent O
in O
every O
direction O
possible O
. O

From O
this O
, O
even O
though O
his O
structuring O
was O
slightly O
off O
track O
he O
was O
able O
to O
verbally O
produce O
some O
great O
sentences O
however O
, O
forgot O
them O
for O
when O
he O
had O
to O
write O
them O
down O
. O

This O
is O
quite O
interesting O
as O
it O
demonstrates O
that O
he O
is O
still O
at O
that O
level O
of O
a O
kindergarten O
/ O
yr O
1 O
student O
, O
being O
able O
to O
verbally O
produce O
a O
sentence O
however O
, O
not O
write O
it O
down O
exactly O
. O

Another O
promising O
skill O
I O
saw O
was O
when O
he O
was O
stuck O
on O
a O
word O
, O
he O
remembered O
he O
wrote O
it O
previously O
and O
therefore O
looked O
back O
at O
the O
word O
to O
help O
him O
spell O
it O
again O
. O

This O
was O
promising O
to O
see O
. O

So C-B
the C-I
question C-I
is C-I
… C-I
should C-I
a C-I
child C-I
who C-I
has C-I
such C-I
significant C-I
learning C-I
difficulties C-I
be C-I
in C-I
a C-I
mainstream C-I
classroom C-I
? C-I

If C-I
the C-I
child C-I
has C-I
support C-I
throughout C-I
all C-I
of C-I
his C-I
schooling C-I
life C-I
, C-I
I C-I
see C-I
why C-I
not C-I
. C-I

He P-B
has P-I
no P-I
behaviour P-I
problems P-I

no P-I
physical P-I
demands P-I
that P-I
will P-I
affect P-I
other P-I
students P-I
in P-I
the P-I
classroom P-I
. P-I

I P-B
do P-I
believe P-I
that P-I
all P-I
students P-I
have P-I
the P-I
right P-I
to P-I
a P-I
good P-I
education P-I
and P-I
although P-I
this P-I
child P-I
is P-I
at P-I
a P-I
low P-I
academic P-I
level P-I
, P-I
he P-I
still P-I
participates P-I
in P-I
class P-I
when P-I
prompted P-I
and P-I
the P-I
other P-I
students P-I
in P-I
the P-I
class P-I
still P-I
communicate P-I
and P-I
play P-I
with P-I
him P-I
even P-I
though P-I
he P-I
is P-I
significantly P-I
behind P-I
academically P-I
. P-I

If P-B
this P-I
child P-I
was P-I
to P-I
be P-I
in P-I
a P-I
special P-I
school P-I
/ P-I
support P-I
unit P-I
the P-I
social P-I

he P-I

he P-I

at P-I

he P-I

there P-I
are P-I
more P-I

The P-B
philosophy P-I
involves P-I
bringing P-I
support P-I
services P-I
to P-I
the P-I
child P-I
within P-I
the P-I
classroom P-I
instead P-I
of P-I
taking P-I
the P-I
student P-I
to P-I
the P-I
services P-I
, P-I
and P-I
stipulates P-I
only P-I
that P-I
the P-I

benefit P-I

“ O

The O
effect O
of O

not O
just O
to O
eat O
away O
at O
the O
sacredness O
of O
the O
name O

to O
eliminate O
the O
sacredness O

thereby O
the O

If O

it O

the O

We O

the O

we O

what O

We O

Regardless O

we O
must O
each O

as O
Oswald O

realize O
that O
“ O
God O

if O

the O

” O

After O

is O
it O
not O

to O
repent O

you O

Our O

When P-B

a P-I
country P-I
, P-I
we P-I
had P-I
a P-I
religiously P-I
diverse P-I
population P-I
, P-I
so P-I
when P-I
we P-I
wrote P-I
the P-I
constitution P-I

we P-I
had P-I
to P-I
say P-I
that P-I
the P-I

not P-I
support P-I
any P-I
religion P-I

there P-I
was P-I
a P-I

the O

Single-sex O
education O
( O
teaching O
males O
and O

in O
separate O
classrooms O
or O
schools O
) O
is O
an O
old O
approach O
to O
instruction O
that O
has O
been O
gaining O
new O
momentum O
in O
the O
education O
reform O
era O
. O

Although O
the O
practice O
has O
long O
existed O
in O
many O
private O
schools O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
relatively O
new O
option O
for O
traditional O
public O
schools O
and O
charter O
schools O
. O

Now O
that O
over O
500 O
public O
schools O
offer O
some O
form O
of O
single-sex O
education O
, O
experts O
are O
renewing O
the O
debate O
over O
the O
value O
of O
separating O
boys O
and O
girls O
in O
the O
classroom O
. O

According O
to O
recent O
research O
on O
the O
differences O

males O
and O
females O
, O
there O
are O
natural O
differences O
in O
how O

approach O

When O
putting O
these O
theories O

however O
, O
experts O
have O
asserted O
that O
separating O

has O
consequences O
that O
extend O
far O
beyond O
the O
act O
of O

. O

Social O
, O
political O

and O
legal O
concerns O
come O
into O

when O

with O

these O
policies O

Proponents P-B
of P-I
same-sex P-I
education P-I
argue P-I
that P-I
a P-I
mixed-gender P-I
classroom P-I
can P-I
be P-I
distracting P-I
for P-I
many P-I
students P-I
, P-I
especially P-I
at P-I
certain P-I
ages P-I
. P-I

Leonard P-I
Sax P-I
, P-I
founder P-I
of P-I
the P-I
National P-I
Association P-I
for P-I
Single-Sex P-I
Public P-I
Education P-I
, P-I
argues P-I
that P-I
while P-I
merely P-I
placing P-I
boys P-I
in P-I
separate P-I
classrooms P-I
from P-I
girls P-I
accomplishes P-I
little P-I
, P-I
single-sex P-I
education P-I
enhances P-I
student P-I
success P-I
when P-I
teachers P-I
use P-I
techniques P-I
geared P-I
toward P-I
the P-I
gender P-I
of P-I
their P-I
students P-I
. P-I

These P-I
techniques P-I
can P-I
vary P-I
from P-I
room P-I
temperature P-I
to P-I
instruction P-I
approaches P-I
. P-I

Some P-B
educators P-I
also P-I
suggest P-I
that P-I
single-sex P-I
education P-I
can P-I
broaden P-I
the P-I
educational P-I
prospects P-I
for P-I
both P-I
the P-I
sexes P-I

While P-I
co-ed P-I
schools P-I
can P-I
reinforce P-I
stereotypes P-I
, P-I
girls P-I
and P-I
boys P-I
can P-I
be P-I
free P-I
to P-I
pursue P-I

A B-B
mother B-I
of B-I
a B-I
single-sex B-I
educated B-I
girl B-I
remarked B-I
, B-I
" B-I
I B-I
feel B-I
that B-I
the B-I

environment B-I
has B-I

the P-I

Bigler P-B
and P-I
Eliot P-I
maintain P-I
that P-I
many P-I
of P-I
the P-I
popular P-I
ideas P-I
about P-I
gender P-I
learning P-I
are P-I
simply P-I
untrue P-I
. P-I

For P-I
example P-I
, P-I
consider P-I
the P-I
theories P-I
that P-I
" P-I
boys P-I
are P-I
visual P-I
learners P-I
" P-I
and P-I
" P-I
girls P-I
are P-I
auditory P-I
learners P-I
. P-I
" P-I

Their P-I
research P-I
suggests P-I
that P-I
learning P-I
is P-I
best P-I
accomplished P-I
when P-I
the P-I
delivery P-I
method P-I
matches P-I
the P-I
subject P-I
matter P-I
. P-I

It P-I
is P-I
the P-I
quality P-I
of P-I
teachers P-I
' P-I
training P-I
, P-I
lessons P-I
, P-I
and P-I
classroom P-I
management P-I
practices P-I
— P-I
and P-I
not P-I
the P-I
sex P-I
of P-I
their P-I
students P-I
— P-I
that P-I
determines P-I
the P-I
quality P-I
of P-I
learning P-I
in P-I
their P-I
classrooms P-I
. P-I

Despite O
the O
debate O
, O
federal O
law O
supports O
the O
option O
of O
single-sex O
education O
in O
public O
schools O
. O

In O
2006 O

Education O
Secretary O

Spellings O
eased O
federal O
regulations O
on O
the O
policy O

One O
solution O
to O
the O
problem O
of O
how O
to O
set O
standards O
for O
schools O
that O
has O
grown O
increasingly O
popular O
in O
the O
U O
. O

is O
the O
use O
of O
private O
schools O

Private P-B
schools P-I
usually P-I
offer P-I
smaller P-I
classrooms P-I
, P-I
and P-I
generally P-I
provide P-I
better P-I
facilities P-I
for P-I
students P-I
. P-I

The P-B
usual P-I
argument P-I
for P-I
private P-I
schools P-I
is P-I
that P-I
they P-I
have P-I
the P-I
freedom P-I
to P-I
offer P-I
any P-I
curriculum P-I
that P-I
they P-I
choose P-I
, P-I
and P-I
the P-I
freedom P-I
to P-I
hire P-I
or P-I
fire P-I
teachers P-I
who P-I
can P-I
teach P-I
effectively P-I
. P-I

Public P-B
schools P-I
receive P-I
money P-I
from P-I
federal P-I
and P-I
state P-I
governments P-I
and P-I
are P-I
obligated P-I
to P-I
do P-I
whatever P-I
the P-I
state P-I
and P-I
national P-I
governments P-I
say P-I
. P-I

This P-I
has P-I
the P-I
effect P-I
of P-I
treating P-I
all P-I
students P-I
the P-I
same P-I
and P-I
teaching P-I
them P-I
the P-I
same P-I
things P-I
, P-I
despite P-I
the P-I
fact P-I
that P-I
every P-I
student P-I
is P-I
unique P-I
, P-I
and P-I
not P-I
all P-I
students P-I
fit P-I
into P-I
the P-I
same P-I
categories P-I
. P-I

Private P-B
schools P-I
do P-I
not P-I
receive P-I
money P-I
from P-I
the P-I
federal P-I
or P-I
state P-I
governments P-I
, P-I
so P-I
they P-I
have P-I
significantly P-I
more P-I
freedom P-I
in P-I
the P-I
types P-I
of P-I
courses P-I
to P-I
offer P-I
, P-I
the P-I
types P-I
of P-I
teachers P-I
they P-I
hire P-I
, P-I
and P-I
the P-I
requirements P-I
for P-I
graduation P-I
. P-I

Since P-B
private P-I
schools P-I
compete P-I
with P-I
each P-I
other P-I
to P-I
gain P-I
students P-I
, P-I
they P-I
have P-I
a P-I
strong P-I
incentive P-I
to P-I
hire P-I
good P-I
teachers P-I
and P-I
offer P-I
good P-I
courses P-I
. P-I

If P-I
a P-I
private P-I
school P-I
is P-I
not P-I
teaching P-I
its P-I
students P-I
well P-I
enough P-I
, P-I
its P-I
graduation P-I
rate P-I
, P-I
or P-I
its P-I
college P-I
acceptance P-I
rate P-I
, P-I
will P-I
sink P-I
, P-I
and P-I
parents P-I
will P-I
be P-I
able P-I
to P-I
quickly P-I
remove P-I
their P-I
child P-I
and P-I
put P-I
him P-I
or P-I
her P-I
into P-I
a P-I
better P-I
school P-I
. P-I

Private P-B
schools P-I
that P-I
compete P-I
with P-I
each P-I
other P-I
for P-I
students P-I
will P-I
be P-I
forced P-I
to P-I
find P-I
the P-I
best P-I
teachers P-I
available P-I
, P-I
and P-I
will P-I
be P-I
able P-I
to P-I
offer P-I
flexibility P-I
that P-I
meets P-I
each P-I
individual P-I
’ P-I
s P-I
educational P-I
needs P-I
. P-I

Additionally P-B
, P-I
private P-I
schools P-I
are P-I
not P-I
encumbered P-I
by P-I
national P-I
teacher P-I
’ P-I
s P-I
unions P-I
or P-I
political P-I
correctness P-I
. P-I

A P-B
private P-I
school P-I
can P-I
choose P-I
to P-I
create P-I
a P-I
new P-I
curriculum P-I
for P-I
auto P-I
mechanics P-I
if P-I
it P-I
wants P-I
to P-I

and P-I
doesn P-I

t P-I
need P-I
to P-I
ask P-I
the P-I
government P-I
for P-I
permission P-I
or P-I
funding P-I
. P-I

The O
primary O
obstacle O
to O
creating O
more O
private O
schools O
is O
cost O

Right O
now O

all O
citizens O
of O
the O
U O

Many O
parents O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
money O
to O
both O
pay O
school O
taxes O
and O
pay O
for O
tuition O
at O
a O
private O
school O
. O

The O
most O
common O
solution O
to O
this O
problem O
is O
called O
a O
school O
voucher O
, O
which O
is O
essentially O
a O
tax O
rebate O
for O
parents O
that O
they O
can O
use O
to O
pay O
private O
tuition O
. O

However O
, O
school O
vouchers O
are O
illegal O
in O
most O
states O
, O
so O
this O
solution O
is O
not O
available O
to O
most O
parents O
. O

Many O
polls O
have O
indicated O
that O
the O
American O
public O
is O
supportive O
to O
the O
idea O
of O
school O
vouchers O
, O
but O
national O
teacher O
’ O

oppose O
them O

so O

what P-I
I P-I
' P-I
m P-I
hearing P-I
a P-I
lot P-I
of P-I
in P-I
our P-I
area P-I
is P-I
parents P-I
( P-I
particularly P-I
of P-I
boys P-I
) P-I
doing P-I
it P-I
because P-I
they P-I
feel P-I
it P-I
will P-I
make P-I
their P-I
kid P-I
the P-I
" P-I
class P-I
leader P-I
" P-I
or P-I
the P-I
" P-I
best P-I
" P-I
in P-I

( P-I
which P-I
is P-I
ridiculous P-I
IMHO P-I
) P-I
. P-I

One O

I O
went O

school O
with O
went O
redshirted O
two O
of O
her O
three O

of O
the O

alone O
( O
apparently O
, O
she O
didn O
' O

she O
had O
the O
option O
with O
the O
first O
one O
but O
would O
have O
redshirted O
his O
too O
if O

had O

) O
. O

She O
claims O
it O
makes O
a O
" O
huge O

difference O
for O

Personally P-B
, P-I
I P-I
' P-I
m P-I
not P-I
sending P-I
my P-I
kids P-I
to P-I
school P-I
to P-I
play P-I
sports P-I
. P-I

I P-I
' P-I
m P-I
sending P-I
them P-I
there P-I
to P-I
learn P-I
. P-I

Plus P-I
, P-I
from P-I
my P-I
own P-I
sports P-I
experience P-I
, P-I
age P-I
has P-I
little P-I
to P-I
do P-I
with P-I
sports P-I
once P-I
you P-I
hit P-I
the P-I
high P-I
school P-I
level P-I
anyway P-I
-- P-I
I P-I
played P-I
Varsity P-I
Volleyball P-I
and P-I
Varsity P-I
Track P-I
as P-I
a P-I
freshman P-I
( P-I
when P-I
I P-I
was P-I
14 P-I
) P-I
. P-I

Most P-I
of P-I
the P-I
team P-I
was P-I
made P-I
up P-I
of P-I
seniors P-I
and P-I
juniors P-I
( P-I
who P-I
were P-I
3 P-I
to P-I
4 P-I
years P-I
older P-I
than P-I
me P-I
) P-I
. P-I

And P-I
really P-I
, P-I
how P-I
can P-I
you P-I
as P-I
a P-I
parent P-I
feel P-I
proud P-I
of P-I
your P-I
child P-I
and P-I
feel P-I
that P-I
he P-I
is P-I
" P-I
better P-I
" P-I
at P-I
sports P-I
than P-I
his P-I
classmates P-I
when P-I
his P-I
classmates P-I
are P-I
2 P-I
years P-I
younger P-I
than P-I
him P-I
. P-I

Seems P-I
a P-I
tad P-I
delusional P-I
to P-I
me P-I
. P-I

For O
us O
, O
we O
are O
having O
the O
opposite O
issue O
-- O
we O
are O
sending O
our O
4 O
YO O
twins O
to O
kindergarten O
early O
because O
they O
are O
academically O
, O
socially O
and O
physically O
ready O
. O

They O
miss O
the O
cut O
off O
by O
three O
months O
here O
, O
so O
it O
' O
s O
been O
an O
issue O
finding O
a O
placement O
for O
them O
. O

So O
all O
this O
redshirting O
means O
that O
they O
are O
likely O
to O
have O
kids O
who O
are O
2 O
years O

He B-I

seemed B-I
very B-I
happy B-I

Then B-I
, B-I
in B-I

Our O
contention O
all O
along O

no O

where O
he O
goes O

is O
that O
everyone O
consider O
the O
whole O

not O
just O
the O
academic O
gains O
or O
his O
emotional O
well-being O

the O
totality O
of O
our O
son O
as O
a O
person O
. O

In O
the O
public O

our O
son O
was O
more O
well-adjusted O

better O

happier O

In O
the O

while O
they O
have O
more O
OT O

and O
he O
is O
making O

he O
is O
having O

A O
stark O
difference O
is O
the O
culture O
of O
the O
non-public O
school O
versus O
the O

The O

a O
very O

attitude O

and O
even O

questions O

concerns O

Hard O
though O
it O
may O
be O
to O
believe O
, O
the O
public O
school O
was O
better O
on O
these O
issues O
. O

The O
non-public O

director O
has O
said O
repeatedly O
that O
we O
are O
welcome O
to O
take O
our O
child O
out O
of O
her O
school O
since O
she O
has O
a O
waiting O
list O

whenever O

I O
graduated O
from O
homeschool O
in O
November O
of O
1994 O
, O
a O
semester O
early O
. O

When O
I O
graduated O
, O
state O
law O
did O
not O
yet O
allow O
( O
or O
perhaps O
had O
just O
allowed O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
remember O
the O
exact O
timeline O
) O
homeschoolers O
to O
simply O
graduate O
. O

We O
had O
to O
have O
a O
GED O
or O
a O
degree O
from O
a O
correspondence O
school O
. O

So O
, O
my O
high O
school O
diploma O
is O
a O
GED O
which O
I O
passed O
with O
flying O
colors O
and O
had O
my O
choice O
of O
colleges O
to O
attend O
. O

Homeschool O
was O
very O
different O
when O
I O
was O
in O
school O
. O

There O
were O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
as O
far O
as O
curriculum O
and O
very O
few O
parents O
continued O
to O
homeschool O
through O
high O
school O
. O

As O
I O
moved O
from O
middle O
school O
into O
high O
school O
, O
my O
friends O
moved O
from O
homeschool O
to O
public O
school O
. O

The O
subjects O
were O
deemed O
too O
difficult O
to O
teach O
at O
home O
. O

I O
was O
all O
alone O
my O
freshmen O
year O
, O
by O
my O
senior O
year O
, O
there O
were O
enough O
high O
school O
homeschoolers O
to O
count O
on O
two O
hands O
. O

Today O
, O
parents O
who O
homeschool O
don O
' O
t O
even O
worry O
about O
high O
school O
or O
diplomas O
. O

For O
me O
, O
geometry O
was O
a O
nightmare O
and O
there O
wasn O
' O
t O
a O
curriculum O
that O
worked O
for O
me O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
really O
grasp O
geometry O
till O
I O
started O
gardening O
. O

Today P-B
' P-I
s P-I
homeschoolers P-I
can P-I
learn P-I
Russian P-I
or P-I
even P-I
geometry P-I
without P-I
their P-I
parent P-I
' P-I
s P-I
assistance P-I
through P-I
DVDs P-I
and P-I
online P-I
courses P-I
. P-I

Homeschool O
has O
morphed O
into O
a O
uniquely O
American O
creation O
. O

We O
should O
all O
be O
proud O
of O
what O
it O
has O
become O
no O
matter O
where O
we O
stand O
on O
the O
homeschool O
versus O
public O
school O
debate O
. O

Today P-B
, P-I
parents P-I
and P-I
students P-I
can P-I
choose P-I
a P-I
variety P-I
of P-I
ways P-I
to P-I
homeschool P-I
. P-I

There P-I
are P-I
co-ops P-I
that P-I
offer P-I
classes P-I
to P-I
all P-I
levels P-I
from P-I
pre-k P-I
to P-I
high P-I
school P-I
. P-I

Some O
offer O
these O
classes O
throughout O
the O
week O
and O
you O
can O
choose O
which O
classes O
to O
take O
. O

Others O
offer O
classes O
once O
a O
week O
and O
parents O
teach O
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
mix O
of O
private O
school O
and O
homeschool O
, O
where O
the O
student O
is O
taught O
in O
a O
classroom O
three O
days O
a O
week O
and O
the O
parent O
downloads O
assignments O
from O
the O
same O
teacher O
the O
other O
two O
days O
a O
week O
. O

You O
can O
participate O
in O
any O
sport O
or O
any O
extracurricular O
function O
via O
these O
co-ops O
that O
you O
can O
in O
public O
school O
. O

There O
is O
football O
, O
cheerleading O
, O
sign O
language O
, O
music O
, O
etc O
. O
There O
are O
field O
trips O
, O
playdates O
, O
study O
groups O
, O
Bible O
studies O
, O
conferences O
( O
for O
all O
ages O
, O
not O
just O
the O
parents O
) O
, O
and O
the O
list O
goes O
on O
. O

The P-B
opportunities P-I
to P-I
socialize P-I
quite P-I
likely P-I
outnumber P-I
those P-I
of P-I
public P-I
school P-I
because P-I
of P-I
the P-I
flexible P-I
time P-I
schedules P-I
. P-I

Some O
families O
homeschool O
year O
round O
, O
taking O
a O
month O
off O
between O
semesters O
to O
visit O
family O
and O
friends O
who O
live O
out O
of O
state O
. O

Deep O
connections O
are O
encouraged O
because O
you O
must O
go O
out O
of O
your O
way O
to O
see O
your O
friends O
. O

You O
don O
' O
t O
sit O
next O
to O
them O
everyday O
, O
so O
you O
make O
time O
to O
spend O
with O
them O
no O
matter O
where O
they O
live O
. O

In O
all O
honesty O
, O
it O
does O
not O
matter O
which O
avenue O
of O
education O
grants O
the O
best O
socialization O
. O

What O
matters O
is O
what O
is O
best O
for O
that O
child O
' O
s O
personality O
? O

Where O
does O
that O

get O
the O
best O
education O
? O

Where O
will O
that O
child O
be O
best O
prepared O

Where O
will O
the O
child O
find O
the O
best O
role O

, O
social O
circles O
, O
and O
friends O
? O

Each O
child O
is O
an O
individual O
. O

Each O
family O
is O
unique O
. O

Each O
school O
district O
is O
different O
. O

Each O
classroom O
environment O
is O
different O
. O

While O
a O
public O
school O
classroom O
is O
perfect O
for O
your O
11-year O
old O
Johnnie O
, O
it O
might O
not O
be O
right O
for O
9-year O
old O
Susie O
. O

While O
a O
particular O
school O
district O
worked O
well O
for O
your O
kids O
, O
perhaps O
moving O
to O
a O
new O
school O
district O
found O
them O
to O
not O
be O
so O
cooperative O
. O

While O
the O
education O
of O
one O
school O
or O
district O
was O
above O
and O
beyond O
imagination O
and O
would O
well O
prepare O
your O
child O
for O

school O
straight O
out O
of O
high O
school O
, O
another O
might O
not O
be O
good O
enough O
to O
get O
the O
same O
child O
into O
college O
. O

While O
one O
child O
may O
be O
an O
extreme O
extrovert O
and O
need O
to O
be O
surrounded O
by O
students O
and O
in O

classroom O
, O
another O
may O
be O
an O
extreme O
introvert O
, O
overwhelmed O
and O

in O
the O

While O
one O
child O
may O
choose O
an O

set O
of O

and O

another O

No O

the O

Each O

The O

of O

anymore O
than O
mentioning O
a O

a O

No O

puts O
their O

great O
consideration O

That O
' O

why O

this O

Back-to-school O
season O
is O
far O
from O
my O
mind O
. O

We O
still O
have O
spring O
and O
summer O
before O
autumn O
Two O
whole O
seasons O
. O

Half O
a O
year O
. O

But O
no O
matter O

In O
most O
parts O
of O
the O
country O
, O
it O
’ O
s O
time O
to O
register O
your O
4- O
and O
5-year-olds O
for O
kindergarten O
. O

Like O
many O
parents O
of O
children O
with O
late-spring O
and O
summer O
birthdays O
, O
I O
must O
decide O
RIGHT O
NOW O
whether O
my O
child O
should O
begin O
kindergarten O
next O
year O
or O
repeat O
preschool O
. O

My O
son O
Ryan O
turns O
5 O
in O
May O
and O
, O
under O
our O
school O
district O
’ O
s O
cutoff O
dates O
, O
he O
is O
eligible O
to O
start O
elementary O
school O
this O
fall O
. O

He O
would O
be O
one O
of O
the O
youngest O
kindergarteners–and O
because O
of O
this O
, O
I O
also O
have O
the O
option O
to O
hold O
him O
back O
( O
or O
redshirt O
him O
) O
. O

The O
idea O
is O
that O
a O
child O
needs O
extra O
time O
to O
catch O
up O
, O
whether O
physically O
, O
academically O
or O
emotionally O
. O

With O
my O
daughter O
, O
I O
would O
have O
preferred O
a O
redshirt O
option O
but O
I O
had O
no O
choice O
because O
she O
has O
a O
December O
birthday O
. O

For O
many O
parents O
, O
the O
Big O
Kindergarten O
Question O
causes O
much O
angst O

Pros O
and O

must O
be O

Temperaments O

As O
do O
long-term O
educational O
goals O
: O
Will O
my O
kid O
still O
get O
into O
Harvard O
if O
he O
starts O
kindergarten O
without O
knowing O
how O
to O
write O
his O
name O
? O

Your O
child O
’ O
s O
future O
success O
starts O
RIGHT O
NOW O
! O

At O
least O
that O
’ O
s O
how O
it O
seems O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
my O
friends O
feel O
the O
stress O
: O
Kindergarten O
or O
preschool O
? O

For O
me O
, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
long O
ago O
: O
Kindergarten O
get O
ready O
for O
Ryan O
. O

I O
believe O
he O
’ O
s O
ready O
because O
: O
* O
He O
knows O
his O
ABCs O
, O
writes O
his O
name O
, O
recognizes O
a O
few O
sites O
words O
and O
grasps O
basic O
math O
concepts O
. O

* O
He O
’ O
s O
in O
the O
90th O
percentile O
for O
height O
and O
weight O
so O
he O
runs O
no O
risk O
of O
being O
picked O
on O
for O
smallness O
. O

* O
He O
is O
familiar O
with O
the O
elementary O
school O
, O
a O
benefit O
of O
having O
an O
older O
sibling O
. O

He O
likes O
it O
and O
seems O
excited O
by O
the O
prospect O
of O
being O
a O
big O
kid O
in O
school O
. O

* O
He O
knows O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
kids O
who O
will O
start O
kindergarten O
with O
him O
( O
thanks O
to O
preschool O
) O
. O

The O
question O
mark O
is O
his O
maturity O
. O

He O
can O
be O
impulsive O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Ryan O
recently O
tried O
to O
help O
a O
friend O
at O
school O
and O
the O
friend O
( O
politely O
, O
kindly O
, O
rightfully O
) O
declined O
Ryan O
’ O
s O
help O
. O

Ryan O
’ O
s O
feelings O
were O
hurt O
so O
he O
hit O
his O
friend O
. O

We O
’ O
re O
working O
on O
such O
things O
and O
, O
in O
recent O
weeks O
, O
I O
’ O
ve O
noticed O
a O
ton O
of O
positive O
changes O
in O
Ryan O
. O

We O
have O
half-a-year O
which O
means O
A O
LOT O
can O
change O
before O
kindergarten O
( O
besides O
, O
since O
when O
did O
kids O
have O
to O
be O
perfect O
for O
kindergarten O
? O
) O
. O

Another O
issue O
is O
Ryan O
’ O
s O
loudness O
. O

( O
His O
hearing O
has O
been O
tested O
and O
, O
yes O
, O
he O
’ O
s O
fine O
) O
. O

It O
’ O
s O
as O
if O
he O
’ O
s O
a O
broken O
volume O
button O
on O
an O
old O
radio O
, O
stuck O
on O
high O
no O
matter O
what O
. O

But O
his O
father O
is O
loud O
and O
so O
is O
his O
older O
sister O
. O

I O
have O
little O
reason O
to O
think O
that O
one O
day O
, O
Ryan O
will O
wake O
up O
with O
a O
hushed O
demeanor O
. O

I O
am O
the O
only O
quiet O
person O
in O
this O
loud O
family O
. O

( O
Please O
, O
pass O
me O
another O
glass O
of O
wine O
) O
. O

Additionally O
, O
Ryan O
can O
have O
short O
attention O
span O
, O
especially O
if O
he O
’ O
s O
bored O
. O

But O
I O
’ O
m O
that O
way O
, O
as O
is O
his O
dad O
and O
his O
sister O
. O

It O
’ O
s O
innate O
, O
a O
brain O
thing O
. O

Ryan O
also O
is O
like O
me O
in O
that O
he O
’ O
s O
observant O
and O
listening O
intensely O
, O
although O
if O
you O
didn O
’ O
t O
know O
him O
, O
or O
me O
, O
you O
might O
think O
we O
’ O
re O
not O
paying O
attention O
. O

But O
trust O
me O
, O
we O
have O
mentally O
filed O
away O
every O
detail O
of O
interest O
and O
can O
almost O
recite O
word-for-word O
what O
was O
said O
. O

Here P-B
’ P-I
s P-I
another P-I
thing P-I
: P-I
A P-I
bored P-I
Ryan P-I
is P-I
trouble P-I
waiting P-I
to P-I
happen P-I
. P-I

I P-I
cannot P-I
imagine P-I
him P-I
spending P-I
a P-I
year P-I
not P-I
moving P-I
forward P-I
with P-I
his P-I
learning P-I
. P-I

He P-I
enjoys P-I
his P-I
preschool P-I
activities P-I
but P-I
if P-I
he P-I
had P-I
to P-I
do P-I
everything P-I
over P-I
again P-I
, P-I
I P-I
envision P-I
lots P-I
of P-I
fussing P-I
about P-I
going P-I
to P-I
school P-I
. P-I

Mornings P-I
would P-I
be P-I
ugly P-I
. P-I

Besides O
, O
the O
biggest O
detriment O
of O
preschool O
boredom O
is O
associating O
disinterest O
with O
school O
. O

No O
one O
wants O
a O
kid O
to O
develop O
the O
habit O
of O
tuning O
out O
. O

My O
belief O
is O

Testimony B-B
: B-I
My B-I

was B-I
held B-I
back B-I
by B-I
going B-I

Transitional B-I
first B-I

( B-I

Not B-I

it B-I

him B-I
straight B-I

but B-I
I B-I
can B-I
attest B-I
that B-I
he B-I
is B-I
a B-I
leader B-I
in B-I
all B-I
things B-I
he B-I
does B-I
– B-I
athletically B-I
, B-I
professionally B-I
, B-I
and B-I
socially B-I
. B-I

He B-I
was B-I
awarded B-I
a B-I
full B-I
athletic B-I
college B-I
scholarship B-I
; B-I
voted B-I
captain B-I

his B-I

by B-I
his B-I

for B-I
three B-I

earned B-I
another B-I

his B-I

had B-I
several B-I
generous B-I
job B-I
offers B-I
to B-I
choose B-I
from B-I

that O
his O

was O
a O

You O
know O
about O
60 O
% O
of O

people O
that O
I O
have O
personally O
met O
are O
hypocrites O
they O

they O

then O
once O

Hell O
not O

Maybe O
just O
a O

choice O
or O
two O

led O
them O
down O
a O
path O
that O
they O
did O
not O

I O
highly O
doubt O
most O

are O
thinking O

themselves O
, O
“ O
You O

That O

O O
’ O

side O
note O
all O
those O
parents O
that O
think O
that O
“ O
Angry O

are O
the O
root O
of O
all O
evil O

its O
what O
’ O
s O
causing O
your O

to O
become O
evil O
and O
lash O
out O

YOU O

your O

may O
be O
playing O
violent O
video O
games O

what O
not O
, O
but O
when O
they O
go O
out O

rape O
or O

someone O
. O

It O
will O
not O
be O
because O
of O
the O

it O
will O
be O
your O
lack O

, O
maybe O
you O

And O
if O
any O
of O
you O
are O
saying O
“ O
Well O
what O
about O
the O
belt O
? O
” O
there O
is O
a O
difference O
between O
getting O

assaulting O

SOCIETY O
SIDE O
NOTE O
: O
The O
reason O
that O
society O
is O
bad O
today O
is O
not O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
Fear O
for O
God O
. O

It O
is O
because O
of O
what O
our O
society O
has O
become O
. O

Our O
society O
has O
become O
so O
concentrated O
on O
how O
people O
FEEL O
. O

That O
if O
someone O
is O
FEELING O
bad O
and O
they O
don O
’ O
t O
FEEL O
like O
going O
to O
work O
today O
then O
they O
don O
’ O
t O
. O

In O
today O
’ O
s O
society O
it O
has O
become O
acceptable O
to O
avoid O
all O
sense O
of O
responsibility O
. O

I O
know O
that O
more O
than O
half O
of O
you O
remember O
when O
you O
were O
young O
if O
you O
didn O
’ O
t O
do O
what O
your O
father O
told O
you O
, O
you O
were O
going O
to O
get O
the O
belt O
, O
and O
you O
know O
what O
you O
sure O
never O
made O
that O
mistake O
again O
. O

Now O
, O
you O
even O
show O
your O
child O
a O
belt O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
hitting O
him O
/ O
her O
and O
your O
own O
child O
can O
sue O
you O
. O

People O
today O
are O
basically O
in O
my O
mind O
, O
for O
a O
lack O
of O
a O
better O
word O
soft O
. O

I O
remember O
my O
Grandfather O
telling O
stories O
of O
the O
horrible O
things O
that O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
do O
in O
WWII O
things O
that O
no O
one O
should O
ever O
have O
to O
go O
through O
, O
NO O
ONE O
( O
at O
19 O
mind O
you O
) O
. O

Yet O
you O
walk O
down O
the O
street O
or O
listen O
to O
the O
18-24ish O
yr O
olds O
today O
and O
they O
are O
complaining O
about O
having O
to O
work O
more O
than O
6 O
hours O
at O
a O
decently O
paying O
job O
. O

Ok O
if O
anyone O
has O
actually O
read O
this O
entire O
thing O
I O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
time O
and O
I O
apologize O
if O
I O
have O
jumped O
around O
a O
lot O
. O

In C-B
conclusion C-I
, C-I
I C-I
personally C-I
believe C-I
that C-I
forcing C-I
prayer C-I
upon C-I
our C-I
children C-I
in C-I
the C-I
class C-I
room C-I
is C-I
wrong C-I
. C-I

If O
you O
want O
prayer O
forced O
send O
your O
child O
to O
a O
religious O
specific O
school O
. O

If P-B
it P-I
is P-I
a P-I
public P-I
school P-I
it P-I
should P-I
be P-I
a P-I
place P-I
where P-I
all P-I
cultures P-I

all P-I

all P-I
people P-I
should P-I
be P-I
able P-I
to P-I
come P-I
and P-I
feel P-I
comfortable P-I
in P-I
order P-I
to P-I
do P-I
what P-I
they P-I
are P-I
there P-I
to P-I
do P-I
which P-I
I P-I
’ P-I
m P-I
sorry P-I
is P-I
not P-I
to P-I
learn P-I
about P-I
religion P-I
. P-I

It O
is O
to O
learn O
and O
become O
educated O
and O
become O
the O
successful O
people O
that O
we O
all O
know O
they O
can O
be O
. O

Forcing O
your O
religion O
on O
someone O
else O
is O
wrong O
and O
if O
your O
faith O
is O
not O
strong O
enough O
to O
withstand O
any O
of O
the O
statements O
above O
without O
you O
becoming O
frustrated O
or O
enraged O
, O
then O
maybe O
you O
should O
visit O
your O
local O
religious O
establishment O
and O
pray O
for O
open O
mindedness O

The O
drift O
toward O
private O
schools O
was O
predicted O
as O
far O
back O
at O
the O
mid O
1980s O
when O
I O
first O
became O
a O
teacher O
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
a O
' O

system O
' O
would O
eventually O
be O
put O
in O
place O
, O
where O
by O
the O
funding O
attached O
to O
each O
student O
would O
' O
travel O
' O
with O
the O
student O
. O

This O
meant O
that O
the O
public O
school O
funding O
would O
be O
dependent O
upon O
demand O
from O
the O
community O
. O

As O
a O
publicly O
educated O
teacher O
I O
was O
concerned O
about O
the O
genesis O
of O
' O
schools O
of O
last O
resort O
' O
. O

Later O
, O
as O
a O
parent O
, O
I O
changed O
direction O
and O
became O
worried O
about O
the O
behaviour O
that O
impeded O
learning O

teaching O
in O
public O
schools- O
behaviour O
that O
I O
witnessed O
first O
hand O

Consequently B-B
I B-I
chose B-I
to B-I
move B-I
my B-I
own B-I
children B-I
from B-I
public B-I
to B-I

own O
up O
to O
being O
part O

the O
problem O
of O
the O
weakening O

the O

I P-B
couldn P-I

abide P-I

my P-I

last O

my O

, O
Markus O
Gerke O

wrote O
brilliantly O
about O
the O
myth O
of O
the O

in O

In O
this O
post O
I O
will O
illustrate O
how O
Title O
IX O
proponents O
and O
believers O
in O
the O
boy O
crisis O
myth O
have O
come O
to O
clash O
over O
the O
topic O
of O
single-sex O
education O
. O

The O
movement O
to O
single-sex O
education O
in O
the O
US O
has O
been O
framed O
as O
a O
solution O
to O
both O
girls O
’ O
absence O
from O
science O
, O
technology O
, O
engineering O
, O
and O
math O
disciplines O
and O
the O
perceived O
decline O
in O
boys O
’ O
overall O
academic O
success O
. O

However O
, O
the O
data O
behind O
these O
assertions O
is O
shaky O
at O
best O
. O

Diane O
Halpern O
, O
Professor O
of O
Psychology O
at O
Claremont O
McKenna O
College O
and O
former O
President O
of O
the O
American O
Psychological O
Association O
, O
wrote O
a O
particularly O
biting O
review O
of O
the O
pro O
single-sex O
education O
literature O
. O

Perhaps O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
pro O
single-sex O
education O
framing O
, O
the O
US O
has O
seen O
an O
increased O
interest O
in O
single-sex O
schooling O
in O
the O
last O
few O
decades O
. O

More O
private O
single-sex O
schools O
have O
emerged O
and O
even O
many O
public O
school O
districts O
have O
begun O
to O
experiment O
with O
single-sex O
programs O
or O
classrooms O
. O

An O
important O
question O
that O
arises O
in O
consideration O
of O
public O
schooling O
, O
though O
, O
is O
if O
separate O
schooling O
is O
actually O
fair O
to O
all O
students O
. O

The O
racialized O
question O
of O
separate O
but O
equal O
in O
education O
was O
answered O
by O
Brown O
v O
. O

Board O
of O
Education O
in O
1954 O
. O

The O
Supreme O
Court O
ruled O
that O
separate O
but O
equal O
in O
regard O
to O
race O
is O
not O
actually O
equal O
at O
all O
. O

Should O
we O
expect O
gendered O
segregation O
of O
schooling O
to O
be O
any O
different O
? O

( O
I O
am O
certainly O
not O
the O
first O

ask O
this O
question O

Leonard C-B
Sax C-I
, C-I
a C-I
psychologist C-I
and C-I
physician C-I
, C-I
argues C-I
not C-I
only C-I
that C-I
gender C-I
segregated C-I
schools C-I
can C-I
be C-I
equal C-I
, C-I
but C-I
that C-I
they C-I
can C-I
be C-I
better C-I
than C-I
coeducational C-I

. C-I

He P-B
argues P-I
that P-I
the P-I
language P-I
of P-I
“ P-I
separate P-I
but P-I
equal P-I
” P-I
in P-I
relation P-I
to P-I
the P-I
single-sex P-I
education P-I
debate P-I
is P-I
out P-I
of P-I
place P-I
because P-I
while P-I
racial P-I
segregation P-I
of P-I
schooling P-I
was P-I
about P-I
limiting P-I
students P-I
’ P-I
access P-I
, P-I
single-sex P-I
education P-I
is P-I
about P-I
broadening P-I
students P-I
’ P-I
access P-I
and P-I
opportunities P-I
. P-I

The O
American O
Civil O
Liberties O
Union O
( O
ACLU O
) O
disagrees O
. O

According C-B
to C-I
the C-I
ACLU C-I
, C-I
not C-I
only C-I
are C-I
sex-segregated C-I
educational C-I
programs C-I
ineffective C-I
, C-I
they C-I
are C-I
illegal C-I

Title P-B
IX P-I
, P-I
which P-I
states P-I
that P-I
“ P-I
No P-I

receiving P-I

” P-I
, P-I
is P-I
where P-I
the P-I
ACLU P-I
and P-I
other P-I
opponents P-I
of P-I
sex-segregated P-I
schools P-I
point P-I
to P-I
bolster P-I
their P-I
claim P-I
of P-I
illegality P-I
. P-I

The O
ACLU O
has O
struggled O
against O
sex-segregated O
schooling O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
but O
earlier O
this O
year O
they O
officially O
launched O
their O
“ O
Teach O
Kids O
, O
Not O
Stereotypes O
” O
campaign O
. O

As B-B
a B-I
part B-I
of B-I
the B-I
campaign B-I
, B-I
they B-I
gathered B-I
data B-I
on B-I
single-sex B-I
education B-I
programs B-I
in B-I
15 B-I
states B-I
and B-I
found B-I
that B-I
the B-I
majority B-I
of B-I
them B-I
were B-I
out B-I
of B-I
compliance B-I
with B-I
Title B-I
IX B-I
requirements B-I
. B-I

Many P-B
of P-I
them P-I
relied P-I
on P-I
outdated P-I
and P-I
scientifically P-I
unfounded P-I
stereotypes P-I
of P-I
boys P-I
and P-I
girls P-I
to P-I
drive P-I
their P-I
curriculum P-I
. P-I

As P-I
a P-I
result P-I
they P-I
were P-I
, P-I
in P-I
fact P-I
, P-I
decidedly P-I
unequal P-I
. P-I

The O
ACLU O
’ O
s O
findings O
have O
led O
them O
to O
challenge O
the O
sex-segregated O
programs O
in O
several O
states O
and O
even O
file O
a O
lawsuit O
against O
a O
West O
Virginia O
program O
. O

The O
single-sex O
education O
question O
is O
, O
at O
least O
in O
part O
, O
a O
legal O
one O
, O
but O
it O
is O
also O
a O
scientific O
one O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
we O
simply O
don O
’ O
t O
have O
sufficient O
evidence O
to O
say O
that O
single-sex O
education O
in O
the O
US O
actually O
works O
. O

Perhaps O
if O
we O
do O
a O
better O
job O
of O
having O
the O
scientific O
conversation O
about O
whether O
or O
not O
single-sex O
education O
actually O
works O
we O
wouldn O
’ O
t O
have O
to O
have O
the O
conversation O
about O
the O
legality O
. O

But O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
high-quality O
research O
, O
why O
err O
on O
the O
side O
of O

the O

What P-B
this P-I

about P-I

when P-I
a P-I

So P-I
, P-I
some P-I
parents P-I
take P-I
their P-I
children P-I
out P-I
of P-I
school P-I
and P-I
abuse P-I
them P-I
so P-I
they P-I
do P-I
not P-I

If O
no O

up O

no O
one O
has O
noticed O
their O
child O

bruises O

And O
so O
children O

It O

no O

go P-I

whom B-I
I B-I

She B-I

It B-I

the B-I

that B-I

That B-I

They B-I
did B-I
nothing B-I

him B-I

just B-I
said B-I

The P-B
school P-I
systems P-I
cannot P-I
afford P-I
to P-I
suspend P-I
or P-I
expel P-I
children P-I
. P-I

They P-I
have P-I

keep P-I

The P-B
private P-I
schools P-I
that P-I
I P-I
have P-I
visited P-I
have P-I
a P-I
form P-I
that P-I
they P-I
want P-I
the P-I
parent P-I
’ P-I
s P-I
sign P-I
, P-I
that P-I
the P-I
children P-I
can P-I
be P-I
disciplined P-I
. P-I

I O
have O
seen O
a O
few O
schools O
that O
if O
the O
form O
is O
not O
signed O
, O
they O
tell O
you O
that O
there O
school O
might O
not O
be O
right O
for O
you O
. O

This O
is O
because O
they O
want O
the O
children O
to O
know O
, O
there O
is O
a O
price O
for O
acting O
up O

I B-B
have B-I
seen B-I
in B-I

would B-I
give B-I

that B-I
act B-I
up B-I
, B-I
to B-I
not B-I
do B-I
it B-I
again B-I

Today O

I O
received O
a O

of O
a O
letter O
that O
my O
local O
MP O
sent O
to O
the O
education O
secretary O
, O
Ed O

. O

This O
letter O
was O
prompted O
by O
my O
concerns O
about O
the O
Badman O
report O
, O
a O
review O
into O
home-education O
which O
was O
submitted O
in O
June O
and O
immediately O
accepted O
by O
Balls O
. O

The O
government O
may O
implement O
these O
recommendations O
by O
including O
them O
in O
the O
Queen O
' O
s O
speech O
on O
18 O
November O
. O

My B-B
six-year-old B-I
daughter B-I
is B-I
educated B-I
by B-I
me B-I
, B-I
at B-I
home B-I
. B-I

I C-B
am C-I
not C-I
a C-I
home-education C-I
evangelist C-I
and C-I
neither C-I
do C-I
I C-I
have C-I
any C-I
problem C-I
with C-I
the C-I
concept C-I
of C-I
school C-I
, C-I
but C-I
I C-I
do C-I
know C-I
that C-I
home C-I
education C-I
works C-I
for C-I
us C-I
. C-I

Badman P-B
' P-I
s P-I
recommendations P-I
would P-I
change P-I
what P-I
home P-I
education P-I
means P-I
to P-I
us P-I
– P-I
a P-I
positive P-I
and P-I
successful P-I
part P-I
of P-I
our P-I
family P-I
life P-I
– P-I
into P-I
an P-I
ongoing P-I
battle P-I
with P-I
the P-I
state P-I
. P-I

It O
would O
be O
compulsory O
for O
me O
to O
register O
with O
the O
local O
authority O
and O
a O
criminal O
offence O
for O
me O
not O
to O
. O

I O
would O
also O
have O
to O
apply O
to O
my O
local O
authority O
for O
approval O
which O
may O
, O
or O
may O
not O
, O
be O
granted O
. O

Even O
if O
granted O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
go O
through O
this O
process O
on O
an O
annual O
basis O
and O
, O
at O
any O
point O
the O
LEA O
could O
refuse O
my O
application O
and O
force O
my O
child O
into O
school O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
fostering O
an O
educational O
environment O
which O
feels O
secure O
for O
the O
child O
, O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
think O
how O
the O
government O
could O
be O
less O
helpful O
. O

My O
greatest O
concern O
about O
Badman O
, O
though O
, O
is O
his O
suggestion O
throughout O
the O
report O
that O
being O
at O
home O
rather O
than O
with O
" O
professionals O
" O
means O
that O
the O
child O
is O
at O
a O
" O
greater O
risk O
of O
harm O
" O
. O

He R-B
claims R-I
that R-I
home R-I
education R-I
is R-I
the R-I
perfect R-I
cover R-I
for R-I
child R-I
abuse R-I
, R-I
but R-I
provides R-I
no R-I
evidence R-I
to R-I
support R-I
this R-I
claim R-I
. R-I

The O
education O
officers O
who O
liaise O
with O
home-educators O
are O
trained O
teachers O
, O
not O
social O
workers O
, O
and O
so O
are O
not O
trained O
in O
the O
highly O
specialised O
field O
of O
child O
abuse O
. O

Under O
the O
new O
regulations O
though O
, O
they O
would O
have O
the O
legal O
right O
to O
enter O
my O
home O
and O
interview O
my O
child O
alone O
in O
a O
room O
to O
" O
check O
" O
for O
signs O
of O
abuse O
, O
not O
because O
of O
any O
good O
reason O
to O
suspect O
abuse O
is O
taking O
place O
, O
but O
simply O
because O
I O
have O
chosen O
to O
home O
educate O
. O

Will O
education O
officers O
also O
be O
going O
into O
schools O
and O
taking O
each O
child O
into O
a O
room O
by O
themselves O
to O
" O
check O
for O
signs O
of O
abuse O
" O
? O

No O
, O
because O
what O
the O
report O
implies O
is O
that O
if O
you O
send O
your O
child O
to O
a O
school O
, O
you O
are O
less O
likely O
to O
be O
a O
child O
abuser O
. O

This O
report O
is O
a O
solution O
without O
a O
problem O
. O

As O
with O
so O
much O
legislation O
that O
the O
government O
has O
managed O
to O
get O
through O
parliament O
under O
the O
emotive O
banner O
of O
" O
child O
welfare O
" O
, O
this O
proposed O
legislation O
peddles O
the O
idea O
that O
children O
can O
only O
be O
dealt O
with O
by O
professionals O
. O

More P-B
and P-I
more P-I
parents P-I

choosing P-I
to P-I

There P-B

that P-I

young P-I

too P-I
often P-I
, P-I
teaching P-I
them P-I
only P-I
to P-I
pass P-I
tests P-I
so P-I
that P-I
civil P-I
servants P-I
can P-I
compile P-I

meaningless P-I
statistics P-I

a B-I

narrow B-I

involves B-I

A P-B
study P-I
conducted P-I
by P-I
the P-I
National P-I
Bureau P-I
of P-I
Economic P-I
Research P-I
in P-I
2011 P-I
said P-I
that P-I
starting P-I
kindergarten P-I
one P-I
year P-I
late P-I
" P-I
substantially P-I
reduces P-I
the P-I
probability P-I
of P-I
repeating P-I
the P-I
third P-I
grade P-I
, P-I
and P-I
meaningfully P-I
increases P-I
in P-I
tenth P-I
grade P-I
math P-I
and P-I
reading P-I
scores P-I
. P-I

Effects P-I
are P-I
highest P-I
for P-I
low P-I
income P-I
students P-I
and P-I
males P-I
. P-I
" P-I

Alternately P-I
, P-I
estimates P-I
suggest P-I
that P-I
entering P-I
kindergarten P-I
early P-I
may P-I
also P-I
have P-I
detrimental P-I
effect P-I

Redshirting R-B
poses R-I
challenges R-I
not R-I
only R-I
to R-I
children R-I
but R-I
to R-I
teachers R-I

" R-I
The R-I

a R-I
half R-I

" R-I
The R-I

deliberately B-I
redshirted B-I
her B-I

she B-I

Gibb O
told O

Gibb P-B
still P-I
thinks P-I
she P-I
made P-I
the P-I
right P-I
choice P-I
not P-I
only P-I
because P-I
her P-I
son P-I
was P-I
" P-I
emotionally P-I
immature P-I
, P-I
" P-I
but P-I
also P-I
because P-I
she P-I
did P-I
not P-I
want P-I
him P-I
to P-I
join P-I
high P-I
school P-I
or P-I
college P-I
at P-I
a P-I
very P-I
young P-I
age P-I
. P-I

" P-I
If P-I
he P-I
' P-I
s P-I
older P-I
, P-I
he P-I
won P-I
' P-I
t P-I
be P-I
easily P-I
manipulated P-I
into P-I
drug P-I
use P-I
and P-I
malpractices P-I
like P-I
this P-I
. P-I

He P-I
might P-I
feel P-I
more P-I
confident P-I
dealing P-I
with P-I
older P-I
students P-I
, P-I
" P-I
she P-I
said P-I
. P-I

Just O
as O
Gibb O
made O
a O
choice O
depending O
on O
her O
son O
' O
s O
emotional O
needs O
, O
Vela O
recommends O
that O
parents O
do O
the O
same O
. O

" O
Parents O
make O
that O
decision O
for O
all O
kinds O
of O
different O
reasons O
. O

We O
can O
test O
a O
child O
academically O
but O
we O
can O
never O
test O
their O
emotional O
readiness O
. O

They P-B
sometimes P-I
are P-I
not P-I
ready P-I
to P-I
leave P-I
home P-I
at P-I
the P-I
age P-I
of P-I
five P-I
and P-I
the P-I
separation P-I
anxiety P-I
will P-I
impact P-I
them P-I
for P-I
a P-I
long P-I
time P-I
. P-I

You O
also O
find O
children O
who O
are O
ready O
to O
leave O
home O
at O
an O
even O
younger O
age O
. O

So O
it O
' O
s O
really O
up O
to O
the O
parent O
to O
decide O
for O
their O
child O
, O

that B-I
when B-I

for B-I
demographic B-I
factors B-I
, B-I
public B-I
schools B-I

better B-I

That O
finding O
will O
no O
doubt O
come O
as O
a O
surprise O
to O
those O
who O
believe O
private O
schools O
are O
intrinsically O
superior O
. O

But P-B
achievement P-I
is P-I
higher P-I
because P-I
students P-I
in P-I
private P-I
schools P-I
come P-I
from P-I
more P-I
affluent P-I
families P-I
than P-I
students P-I
in P-I
public P-I
schools P-I
, P-I
rather P-I
than P-I
because P-I
of P-I
better P-I
practices P-I
. P-I

This P-I
distinction P-I
is P-I
crucial P-I
. P-I

The P-I
national P-I
average P-I
of P-I
public P-I
schools P-I
is P-I
pulled P-I
down P-I
by P-I
the P-I
number P-I
of P-I
such P-I
schools P-I
serving P-I
poor P-I
students P-I
. P-I

If P-I
these P-I
schools P-I
were P-I
eliminated P-I
, P-I
schools P-I
in P-I
the P-I
affluent P-I
suburbs P-I
would P-I
hold P-I
their P-I
own P-I
against P-I
the P-I
best P-I
private P-I
schools P-I
. P-I

It P-B
' P-I
s P-I
important P-I
to P-I
remember P-I
too P-I
that P-I
private P-I
schools P-I
are P-I
neither P-I
required P-I
to P-I
hire P-I
certified P-I
teachers P-I
nor P-I
administer P-I
state P-I
tests P-I
. P-I

They P-B
also P-I
have P-I
wide P-I
latitude P-I
in P-I
deciding P-I
which P-I
students P-I
to P-I
admit P-I
and P-I
which P-I
to P-I
push P-I
out P-I
. P-I

In P-I
short P-I
, P-I
they P-I
operate P-I
entirely P-I
differently P-I
. P-I

Therefore O
, O
I O
' O
ll O
go O
a O
step O
farther O
. O

Even O
when O
socioeconomic O
factors O
are O
controlled O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
it O
' O
s O
fair O
to O
compare O
private O
schools O
with O
public O
schools O
. O

I O
also O
hasten O
to O
note O
that O
most O
of O
the O
schools O
in O
the O
Lubienskis O
' O
study O
were O
religious O
schools O
. O

These O
hardly O
constitute O
the O
totality O
of O
private O
schools O
in O
this O
country O
. O

So O
before O
drawing O
any O
definitive O
conclusions O
, O
we O
need O
to O
know O
how O
other O
private O
schools O
compare O
. O

I B-B
am B-I
a B-I
teacher B-I
( B-I
currently B-I
SAHM B-I
) B-I
and B-I
worked B-I
in B-I
a B-I

for B-I
children B-I
with B-I
severe B-I
learning B-I

For C-B
the C-I
majority C-I
of C-I
the C-I

in C-I
the C-I

, C-I
mainstream C-I
would C-I
not C-I

Many P-B
didn P-I
' P-I
t P-I
speak P-I
at P-I
all P-I
, P-I
had P-I
extremely P-I
challenging P-I
behavior P-I
and P-I
needed P-I
to P-I
access P-I
the P-I
curriculum P-I
in P-I
a P-I
very P-I
different P-I
way P-I
to P-I
how P-I
they P-I
would P-I
in P-I
a P-I
mainstream P-I
setting P-I
. P-I

Their P-B
needs P-I
can P-I
be P-I
far P-I
better P-I
met P-I
in P-I
a P-I
specialist P-I
school P-I
with P-I
specialist P-I
teachers P-I
and P-I
resources P-I
. P-I

No P-I
offended P-I
intended P-I
to P-I
teachers P-I
in P-I
mainstream P-I
settings-I P-I
just P-I
think P-I
it P-I
' P-I
s P-I
a P-I
lot P-I
to P-I
ask P-I
when P-I
they P-I
may P-I
have P-I
a P-I
class P-I
of P-I
30+ P-I
children P-I
with P-I
completely P-I
different P-I
needs P-I
to P-I
consider P-I
and P-I
limited P-I
training P-I
in P-I
SEN P-I
. P-I

In C-B
some C-I
cases C-I
, C-I
inclusion C-I
can C-I
work C-I
fantastically C-I
well C-I
. C-I

My B-B
school B-I
had B-I
an B-I
inclusion B-I
class B-I
attached B-I
to B-I
a B-I
local B-I
mainstream B-I
school B-I
. B-I

The P-B
pupils P-I
would P-I
spend P-I
the P-I
majority P-I
of P-I
the P-I
time P-I
in P-I
the P-I
inclusion P-I
classroom P-I
, P-I
but P-I
spend P-I
a P-I
few P-I
lessons P-I
a P-I
week P-I
in P-I
a P-I
mainstream P-I
class P-I
( P-I
with P-I
a P-I
known P-I
teaching P-I
assistant P-I
) P-I
. P-I

They P-I
usually P-I
went P-I
in P-I
for P-I
sessions P-I
like P-I
Art P-I
, P-I
where P-I
the P-I
difference P-I
in P-I
ability P-I
is P-I
less P-I
obvious P-I
. P-I

This P-I
worked P-I
really P-I
well P-I
. P-I

I O
think O
that O
where O
inclusion O
is O
being O
considered O
, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
carefully O
planned O
to O
meet O
the O
childs O
needs O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
really O
destructive O
when O
inclusion O
fails O
. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
build O
up O
to O
inclusion O
gradually O
where O

us P-I

So O
we O
had O
to O
do O
what O

by O
finding O
a O
school O

And P-B
I P-I
never P-I

that P-I
I P-I

all P-I

are P-I
like P-I
the P-I
Duggars P-I

all P-I
socially P-I
awkward P-I

just P-I
that P-I
the P-I
overall P-I
" P-I

Do O
I O
still O
think O
a O
decent O
majority O
of O
homeschoolers O
do O
it O
for O
reasons O
like O
sheltering O
kids O
, O
religion O
, O
wanting O
to O
keep O

Yes O
I O
do O

I O
' O

sorry O

I O
do O

Do O
I O
judge O
all O
families O
that O
choose O

on O
that O
? O

No O
way O

it O

“ O
The O
Great O
Debate O
: O
to O

As O
a O
homeschooling O
parent O
of O
five O
children O
for O
over O
a O
decade O
, O
the O
most O
frequent O
question O
I O
receive O
is O
, O
“ O
what O
about O
socialization O
? O
” O

A O
woman O
recently O
contacted O
me O
saying O
she O
desired O
to O
homeschool O
her O
child O
but O
the O
socialization O
issue O
was O
keeping O
her O
from O
doing O
so O
. O

Let O
’ O
s O
take O
a O
look O
at O
this O
. O

There O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
myth O
that O
homeschoolers O
do O
not O
receive O
proper O
socialization O
. O

This O
usually O
comes O
from O
people O
who O
do O
not O
understand O
homeschooling O
or O
those O
deeply O
involved O
in O
public O
education O
. O

In P-B
reality P-I
, P-I
the P-I
majority P-I
of P-I
homeschoolers P-I
are P-I
provided P-I
with P-I
plenty P-I
of P-I
social P-I
opportunities P-I
. P-I

The O
stereotype O
that O
home O
learners O
spend O
their O
days O
isolated O
from O
society O
at O
kitchen O
tables O
with O
workbooks O
in O
hand O
could O
be O
nothing O
but O
farther O
from O

The B-I
National B-I
Home B-I
Education B-I

five B-I

social B-I
activities B-I

How O

One P-B
reason P-I
we P-I
choose P-I
to P-I
homeschool P-I
is P-I
because P-I
our P-I
family P-I
wanted P-I
to P-I
maintain P-I
family P-I
relationships P-I
in P-I
a P-I
way P-I
that P-I
cannot P-I
be P-I
done P-I
if P-I
our P-I
children P-I
are P-I
in P-I
school P-I
six-plus P-I
hours P-I
a P-I
day P-I
. P-I

Life O
is O
short O
and O
we O
want O
to O
spend O
the O
majority O
of O
our O
time O
together O
. O

Children O
grow O
up O
quickly O
and O
before O
you O
know O
it O
, O
they O
are O
heading O
off O
on O
their O
own O
. O

Of O
course O
this O
is O
not O
the O
only O
reason O
to O
homeschool O
but O
since O
we O
are O
interacting O
with O
each O
other O
all O
day O
long O
, O
it O
forces O
us O
to O
deal O
with O
relationship O
issues O
when O
they O
come O
up O
. O

We P-B
enjoy P-I
being P-I
around P-I
our P-I
children P-I
and P-I
they P-I
enjoy P-I
being P-I
around P-I
us P-I
. P-I

We P-I
not P-I
only P-I
have P-I
a P-I
strong P-I
parental P-I
relationship P-I
but P-I
the P-I
siblings P-I
do P-I
as P-I
well P-I
. P-I

This P-I
alone P-I
is P-I
a P-I
wonderful P-I
opportunity P-I
for P-I
building P-I
social P-I
skills P-I
. P-I

In O
fact O
, O
the O
National O
Home O

disclosed O
that O
the O
36 O

We O
choose O
to O
be O
the O
primary O
influence O
in O
our O
children O
’ O
s O
life O
and O
know O
it O
is O
the O
right O
decision O
for O
our O
family O

Each O

must O

decision O
to O
do O
what O
is O
best O
for O
them O
whether O
it O

But O
lack O

a O

our O

This O

another O

that O
we O
are O

terrible O

Honesty O

in O
our O

Two O

went O
into O

some O

The O
lock O

was O
broken O

the O

the O

Once O

they O
left O

Last O
week O
I O
learned O
the O
definition O
of O
“ O
going O
viral O
. O
” O

, O
specifically O
my O
bias O
against O
homeschooling O
before O
doing O
the O
research O
. O

Like O
most O
certified O
teachers O
I O
did O
not O
hold O
this O
method O
of O
education O
in O
very O
high O
regard O
. O

After O
all O
, O
I O
have O
a O
Master O
of O
Arts O
in O
Teaching O
, O
I O
did O
my O
time O
doing O
internships O
and O
student O
teaching O
, O
and O
I O
am O
experienced O
at O
teaching O
in O
the O
classroom O
. O

So O
what O
makes O
your O
average O
mom O
or O
dad O
think O
they O
can O
do O
my O
job O
with O
no O
degree O
and O
no O
experience O
? O

Then C-B
I C-I
did C-I
the C-I
research C-I
and C-I
found C-I
, C-I
for C-I
the C-I
most C-I
part C-I
, C-I
that C-I
they C-I
are C-I
doing C-I
a C-I
fine C-I
job C-I
and C-I
I C-I
said C-I
so C-I
. C-I

The O
next O
thing O
I O
know O
there O
are O
thousands O
of O
readers O
“ O
recommending O

my O
article O
on O
their O
Facebook O
pages O

I O
have O
written O
more O
than O
a O
hundred O
articles O
for O
this O
column O
and O
this O
has O
never O
happened O
before O
. O

Obviously O
, O
I O
touched O
a O
nerve O
and O
found O
out O
first-hand O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
cohesiveness O
among O
homeschooling O
community O
. O

After O
reading O
all O
the O
comments O
attached O
to O
this O
article O
I O
would O
like O
to O
address O
some O
of O
them O
: O
Thank O
you O
for O
your O
encouragement O
to O
homeschool O
my O
boys O
. O

However O
, O
one O

and O
the O
other O
is O
going O

the P-I

1 P-I
reason P-I
( P-I
36% P-I

parents P-I

for P-I
religious P-I
reasons P-I

Actually P-I
, P-I
after P-I
reading P-I
the P-I

that P-I
is P-I
about P-I
the P-I
same P-I
percentage P-I
as P-I
my P-I

who P-I
choose P-I

homeschool P-I

I O
have O
been O
known O
to O
crunch O
some O
granola O
myself O
and O
do O
not O
view O
this O
as O
a O
bad O
thing O
. O

I O
was O
rather O
offended O
at O
the O
teacher O
bashing O
. O

If O
you O
show O
respect O
to O
the O
teachers O
, O
they O
just O
might O
return O
the O
favor O
. O

Actually O
, O
I O
don O
’ O
t O
remember O
any O
teacher O
I O
worked O
with O
ever O
saying O
a O
negative O
word O
about O
homeschooling O
. O

Many O
parents O
commented O
that O
they O
can O
get O
through O
their O
lesson O
plans O
in O
just O
a O
few O
hours O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
six O
hours O
of O
instruction O
it O
takes O
in O
school O
. O

This O
is O
because O
there O
is O
no O
classroom O
management O
to O
deal O
with O
, O
and O
there O
are O
often O
questions O
and O
discussion O
during O
lessons O
. O

In O
a O
class O
of O
25 O
this O
takes O
some O
time O
, O
but O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
for O
students O
to O
hear O
the O
various O
perspectives O
and O
express O
their O
views O
among O
their O
peers O
. O

Homeschooled P-B
students P-I
do P-I
have P-I
more P-I
time P-I
to P-I
pursue P-I
extracurricular P-I
activities P-I
as P-I
opposed P-I
to P-I
their P-I
exhausted P-I
public P-I
school P-I
peers P-I
. P-I

Teachers P-B
teach P-I
to P-I
the P-I
test P-I
because P-I
that P-I
is P-I
what P-I
they P-I
are P-I
instructed P-I
to P-I
do P-I
by P-I
administrations P-I
that P-I
are P-I
under P-I
pressure P-I
for P-I
government P-I
funding P-I
. P-I

I B-B
found B-I
it B-I
fascinating B-I
that B-I
homeschooled B-I
children B-I
, B-I
who B-I
are B-I
not B-I
being B-I
taught B-I
to B-I
the B-I
test B-I
, B-I
on B-I
the B-I
whole B-I
do B-I
much B-I
better B-I
than B-I
their B-I
public B-I
school B-I
counterparts B-I
. B-I

The O
statistics O
showing O
the O
higher O
test O
scores O
may O
be O
skewed O
because O
parents O
of O
homeschooled O
kids O
are O
not O
required O
to O
take O
or O
report O
scores O
for O
standardized O
tests O
in O
many O
states O
. O

In O
public O
school O
everyone O
must O
take O
standardized O
tests O
and O
schools O
must O
report O
the O
scores O
. O

The O
cost O
of O
homeschooling O
varies O
widely O
. O

Some O
parents O
bring O
in O
tutors O
or O
enroll O
their O
children O
in O
enrichment O
programs O
driving O
up O
the O
cost O
. O

Many O
parents O
recycle O
curriculum O
among O
siblings O
, O
get O
groups O
together O
for O
the O
group O
rate O
when O
visiting O
museums O
, O
and O
get O
free O
materials O
from O
the O
library O
or O
online O
to O
cut O
costs O
. O

One O
of O
the O
biggest O
myths O
about O
homeschooled O
kids O
is O
that O
they O
are O
poorly O
socialized O
. O

My P-B

at P-I

of P-I

He P-I
would P-I
come P-I

so P-I
frustrated P-I
because P-I
the P-I

spent P-I
most P-I

trying P-I

what P-I
he P-I

Only P-I
to P-I
be P-I
more P-I
frustrated P-I
because P-I
there P-I
were P-I
about P-I
60 P-I

in P-I
the P-I

who P-I
all P-I

took O

The O
report O
that O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
parents O
in O
this O
country O
are O
seeking O
to O
homeschool O
their O
children O
is O
not O
at O
all O
surprising O
. O

However O
, O
some O
persons O
expressed O
confusion O
about O
this O
admission O
from O
an O
official O
of O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Education O
recently O
, O
because O
of O
the O
high O
standard O
of O
education O
we O
afford O
our O
children O
at O
the O
nursery O
, O
primary O
and O
secondary O
levels O
. O

We O
in O
Barbados O
think O
of O
homeschooling O
as O
an O
activity O
that O
occurs O
only O
in O
North O
American O
countries O
or O
perhaps O
further O
afield O
, O
and O
cannot O
imagine O
why O
in O
a O
country O
that O
offers O
free O
education O
to O
all O
school O
aged O
children O
, O
a O
parent O
would O
want O
to O
take O
on O
the O
responsibility O
of O
teaching O
their O
child O
. O

It P-B
is P-I
a P-I
question P-I
I P-I
used P-I
to P-I
ask P-I
myself P-I
some P-I
years P-I
ago P-I
, P-I
until P-I
I P-I
recognised P-I
that P-I
the P-I
school P-I
environment P-I
of P-I
today P-I
is P-I
much P-I
more P-I
explosive P-I
than P-I
it P-I
was P-I
just P-I
a P-I
few P-I
decades P-I
ago P-I
. P-I

The P-I
media P-I
coverage P-I
here P-I
and P-I
abroad P-I
about P-I
bullying P-I
, P-I
teasing P-I
as P-I
well P-I
as P-I
physical P-I
and P-I
emotional P-I
abuse P-I
in P-I
public P-I
schools P-I
is P-I
abundant P-I
, P-I
and P-I
it P-I
could P-I
make P-I
a P-I
parent P-I
want P-I
to P-I
protect P-I
their P-I
children P-I
from P-I
that P-I
bad P-I
environment P-I
. P-I

Certainly O
there O
are O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
to O
homeschooling O
and O
if O
it O
is O
an O
area O
that O
is O
gaining O
currency O
in O
this O
country O
, O
the O
relevant O
authorities O
will O
need O
to O
do O
some O
probing O
to O
ensure O
that O
parents O
are O
giving O
their O
children O
instruction O
in O
the O
right O
manner O
, O
and O
are O
not O
in O
fact O
putting O
their O
children O
at O
a O
disadvantage O
. O

It O
will O
no O
doubt O
require O
that O
officials O
of O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Education O
create O
measures O
to O
guide O
parents O
opting O
to O
go O
this O
route O
, O
and O
by O
extension O
require O
them O
to O
visit O
these O
homes O
to O
observe O
what O
is O
being O
done O
. O

Indeed O
, O
if O
homeschooling O
is O
really O
on O
the O
rise O
, O
Government O
may O
have O
to O
seek O
parliamentary O
approval O
to O
institute O
laws O
and O
regulations O
to O
govern O
this O
method O
of O
teaching O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
this O
is O
already O
the O
case O
, O
but O
I O
believe O
that O
it O
would O
serve O
the O
State O
well O
to O
treat O
homeschooling O
as O
a O
type O
of O
private O
school O
and O
require O
that O
they O
meet O
the O
same O
standards O
as O
those O
registered O
facilities O
. O

Some O
parents O
may O
see O
this O
as O
an O
invasion O
of O
their O
privacy O
and O
an O
intrusion O
, O
but O
the O
State O
has O
a O
responsibility O
to O
ensure O
that O
all O
children O
living O
in O
this O
country O
are O
properly O
educated O
. O

I O
make O
that O
point O
because O
teachers O
specialise O
in O
specific O
subject O
areas O
and O
if O
parents O
choose O
to O
homeschool O
their O
children O
, O
it O
is O
expected O
that O
they O
would O
have O
vast O
knowledge O
of O
each O
subject O
area O
which O
they O
choose O
to O
teach O
their O
children O

kindergarten O
entrance O
, O
which O
was O
charged O
with O
palatable O
anxiety O
over O
whether O
their O
child O
should O
start O
this O
coming O
year O
or O
wait O
a O
year O
. O

Each O
mother O
shared O
their O
respective O
observations O
of O
their O
kids O
, O
explaining O
how O
they O
came O
to O
their O
decision O
, O
when O
one O
mother O
interrupted O
, O
turned O
to O
me O
, O
pointed O
, O
and O
said O
, O
“ O
I O
want O
to O
know O
what O
you O
would O
do O
. O

I O
want O
to O
know O
when O
you O
are O
going O
to O
send O
your O
son O
to O
kindergarten O
! O
” O

The O
emotion O
behind O
her O
statements O
threw O
me O
off O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
since O
that O
time O
I O
’ O
ve O
been O
giving O
this O
topic O
a O
lot O
of O
thought O
, O
since O
it O
is O
clearly O
a O
topic O
about O
which O
many O
parents O
are O
thinking O
, O
are O
feeling O
strongly O
, O
and O
are O
looking O
for O
direction O
. O

How O
prevalent O
is O
redshirting O
anyway O
? O

A O
new O
, O
and O
sound O
, O
study O
just O
revealed O
that O
is O
a O
lot O
less O
common O
than O
people O
perceive O
. O

Only O
about O
4-5% O
of O
kids O
start O
kindergarten O
a O
year O
after O
their O
birth O
date O
allows O
. O

This O
number O
is O
lowest O
among O
low O
income O
African O
American O
children O
( O
1% O
) O
, O
presumably O
because O
of O
the O
cost O
to O
the O
family O
to O
provide O
another O
year O
of O
childcare O
, O
and O
highest O
within O
communities O
with O
a O
mean O
household O
income O
of O
$100 O
, O
000 O
or O
greater O
( O
7% O
) O
. O

Even O
despite O
this O
range O
, O
the O
overall O
frequency O
is O
much O
lower O
than O
previously O
thought O
. O

So R-B
, R-I
does R-I
delaying R-I
kindergarten R-I
give R-I
kids R-I
a R-I
head R-I
start R-I
? R-I

It R-I
appears R-I
that R-I
it R-I
can R-I
, R-I
at R-I
least R-I
for R-I
the R-I
first R-I
few R-I
years R-I
of R-I
elementary R-I
school R-I
, R-I
and R-I
this R-I
is R-I
especially R-I
true R-I
for R-I
kids R-I
who R-I
are R-I
already R-I
at R-I
risk R-I
for R-I
school R-I
difficulties R-I
due R-I
to R-I
socio-economic R-I
factors R-I
( R-I
unfortunately R-I
those R-I
are R-I
also R-I
the R-I
kids R-I
who R-I
are R-I
least R-I
likely R-I
to R-I
start R-I
later R-I
) R-I
. R-I

However F-B
, F-I
evidence F-I
also F-I
indicates F-I
that F-I
age F-I
at F-I
school F-I
entry F-I
is F-I
a F-I
poor F-I
predictor F-I
of F-I
school F-I
success F-I
, F-I
with F-I
younger F-I
children F-I
performing F-I
just F-I
as F-I
well F-I
or F-I
better F-I
than F-I
their F-I
older F-I
peers F-I
. F-I

And P-B
, P-I
some P-I
studies P-I
indicate P-I
that P-I
children P-I
who P-I
are P-I
redshirted P-I
also P-I
have P-I
higher P-I
use P-I
of P-I
special P-I
education P-I
services P-I
in P-I
elementary P-I
school P-I
and P-I
higher P-I
rates P-I
of P-I
behavioral P-I
problems P-I
in P-I
adolescence P-I
. P-I

This P-I
may P-I
be P-I
because P-I
the P-I
children P-I
who P-I
parents P-I
initially P-I
thought P-I
were P-I
immature P-I
and P-I
in P-I
need P-I
of P-I
an P-I
additional P-I
year P-I
, P-I
where P-I
actually P-I
exhibiting P-I
early P-I
symptoms P-I
of P-I
a P-I
larger P-I
problem P-I
and P-I
could P-I
have P-I
benefited P-I
from P-I
early P-I
intervention P-I
. P-I

Although O
I O
am O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
examining O
the O
data O
to O
inform O
parenting O
, O
the O
results O
often O
do O
not O
reveal O
a O
clear O
path O
, O
and O
although O
group O
level O
statistics O
are O
useful O
, O
they O
do O
not O
tell O
parents O
what O
their O
individual O
child O
’ O
s O
trajectory O
will O
be O
. O

What O
is O
clear O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
given O
redshirting O
is O
much O
less O
common O
than O
originally O
thought O
, O
parents O
should O
worry O
less O
about O
how O
their O
child O
’ O
s O
age O
will O
compare O
to O
peers O
( O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
hold O
them O
back O
just O
so O
they O
won O
’ O
t O
be O
much O
younger O
than O
most O
of O
their O
peers O
) O
and O
more O
about O
the O
signals O
their O
own O
children O
are O
giving O
them O
. O

The O
big O
areas O
to O
consider O
are O
: O
social O
skills O
( O
ability O
to O
initiate O
and O
maintain O
play O
, O
sharing O
, O
understanding O
of O
own O
and O
others O
’ O
emotions O
) O
, O
academic O
skills O
( O
knowledge O
of O
content O
areas O
such O
as O
letter O
/ O
number O
recognition O
and O
phonics O
) O
, O
ability O
to O
regulate O
impulses O
( O
staying O
on O
task O
, O
following O
directions O
) O
, O
and O
fine O
motor O
skills O
( O
fine O
motor O
skills O
have O
been O
linked O
with O
academic O
success O
above O
and O
beyond O
content O
knowledge O
and O
attentional O
abilities O
) O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
teachers O
rate O
enthusiasm O
to O
learn O
, O
ability O
to O
follow O
directions O
, O
and O
attention O
span O
as O
the O
most O
important O
factors O
for O
kindergarten O
success O
, O
less O
so O
than O
actual O
academic O
knowledge O
( O
which O
parents O
tend O
to O
perceive O
as O
most O
important O
) O
. O

Given O
the O
research O
on O
the O
topic O
, O
if O
you O
have O
concerns O
about O
your O
child O
’ O
s O
behavior O
and O
that O
is O
why O
you O
are O
considering O
delaying O
them O
, O
this O
is O
important O
information O
that O
may O
signal O
your O
child O
would O
benefit O
from O
behavioral O
intervention O
, O
if O
not O
immediately O
than O
it O
is O
something O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
as O
they O
progress O
through O
their O
early O

So B-B
what B-I
is B-I
the B-I
answer B-I
to B-I
the B-I
question B-I
originally B-I
asked B-I
of B-I
me B-I
at B-I
that B-I
cocktail B-I
party B-I
? B-I

What B-I
will B-I
I B-I
do B-I
for B-I

? B-I

Well B-I
, B-I
he B-I
will B-I
be B-I
5 B-I

/ B-I

at B-I
the B-I
time B-I
of B-I
kindergarten B-I
. B-I

That B-I
February B-I
birthday B-I
excuses B-I
me B-I
from B-I
much B-I
of B-I
this B-I
anxiety B-I
. B-I

But B-I
even B-I
beyond B-I
that B-I
, B-I
I B-I
see B-I
him B-I
being B-I
very B-I
enthusiastic B-I
about B-I
learning B-I
and B-I
I B-I
want B-I
to B-I
give B-I
him B-I
as B-I
many B-I
opportunities B-I
as B-I
I B-I
can B-I
to B-I
foster B-I
that B-I
curiosity B-I
. B-I

I B-I
think B-I
he B-I
is B-I
a B-I
kid B-I
who B-I
is B-I
in B-I
danger B-I
of B-I
getting B-I
bored B-I
in B-I
a B-I
less B-I
stimulating B-I
/ B-I
demanding B-I
environment B-I
. B-I

After B-I
his B-I
first B-I
day B-I
of B-I
preschool B-I
he B-I
was B-I
disappointed B-I
because B-I
“ B-I
I B-I
didn B-I
’ B-I
t B-I
learn B-I
anything B-I
. B-I
” B-I

Socially B-I
, B-I
I B-I
do B-I
wonder B-I
if B-I
being B-I
older B-I
would B-I
be B-I
helpful B-I
for B-I
him B-I
, B-I
especially B-I
since B-I
in B-I
adolescence B-I
it B-I
is B-I
socially B-I
advantageous B-I
for B-I
boys B-I
to B-I
hit B-I
puberty B-I
early B-I
( B-I
it B-I
is B-I
risk B-I
factor B-I
for B-I
girls B-I
) B-I
because B-I
that B-I
means B-I
physical B-I
strength B-I
. B-I

But B-I
, B-I
at B-I
this B-I
point B-I
he B-I
keeps B-I
up B-I
well B-I
with B-I
friends B-I
who B-I
are B-I
a B-I
year B-I
or B-I
more B-I
older B-I
, B-I
and B-I
prefers B-I
their B-I
company B-I
to B-I
kids B-I
who B-I
are B-I
a B-I
few B-I
months B-I
younger B-I
. B-I

In B-I
some B-I
ways B-I
being B-I
surrounded B-I
by B-I
older B-I
kids B-I
is B-I
much B-I
easier B-I
because B-I
they B-I
tend B-I
to B-I
be B-I
more B-I
prosocial B-I
and B-I
they B-I
model B-I
social B-I
skills B-I
from B-I
which B-I
Leo B-I
can B-I
benefit B-I
. B-I

Taken B-I
together B-I
, B-I
the B-I
risk B-I
of B-I
Leo B-I
becoming B-I
bored B-I
outweighs B-I
any B-I
concerns B-I
I B-I
have B-I
about B-I
him B-I
socially B-I
. B-I

This B-I
coming B-I
year B-I
of B-I

of B-I
being B-I

a B-I
traditional B-I

I B-I

none O

If P-B

That O
would O
still O
be O
a O
step O

what O

No O

Teaching P-I
" P-I
God P-I

then P-I
praying P-I

that P-I

something P-I
else P-I

“ O

it O

I O

I O

Those O
who O

bail O

end O
up O

ones O

I O
also O
recognize O
that O
there O
are O
deep O
roots O
to O
explore O
when O
we O
look O
at O
who O
is O
attending O
private O
versus O
public O

, O
and O
it O
certainly O
bears O
looking O
at O
why O
people O
make O
those O
choices O

rather O
than O
dismissing O
them O
as O
not O
compelling O
enough O
like O
Benedikt O

Using O
Benedikt O
’ O

rational O
, O
if O
everyone O

they O
would O
somehow O

son C-I

public C-I

I O
wish O
we O
had O
a O
better O
way O
to O
fund O
schools O
then O
based O
on O
property O
lines O
and O
tax O
dollars O
. O

The O
way O
the O
current O
system O
works O
, O
schools O
in O
lower-class O
neighborhoods O
are O
overcrowded O
and O
underfunded O
, O
while O
schools O
in O
wealthier O
districts O
enjoy O
the O
benefits O
of O
higher O
taxes O
— O
and O
yet O
, O
even O
many O
of O
them O
are O
also O
underfunded O
. O

But O
here O
’ O
s O
the O
thing O
: O
sending O
my O
child O
to O
a O
private O
school O
does O
not O
exempt O
me O
from O
paying O
city O
and O
state O
taxes O
that O
help O
fund O
public O
schools O
, O
nor O
would O
I O
want O
it O
to O
. O

Benedikt O
, O
in O
her O
push O
to O
help O
promote O
public O
education O
, O
seems O
to O
think O
that O
the O
best O
way O
to O
fix O
the O
public O
school O
system O
is O
to O
shame O
parents O
into O
sending O
all O
the O
kids O
there O
. O

Overcrowding O
public O
schools O
isn O
’ O
t O
going O
to O
solve O
anything O
. O

The O
current O
formula O
for O
funding O
public O
schools O
doesn O
’ O
t O
automatically O
mean O
a O
bunch O
more O
money O
per O
school O
for O
each O
new O
student O
who O
enrolls O
. O

And O
shaming O
parents O
over O
it O
is O
only O
going O
to O
further O
the O
divide O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
schooling O
. O

More O
students O
attending O
public O
school O
doesn O
’ O
t O
automatically O
mean O
more O
involved O
parents O
either O
. O

Benedikt O
’ O
s O
argument O
stands O
on O
shaky O
legs O
and O
seems O
fueled O
solely O
by O
judgement O
( O
which O
she O
admits O
) O
rather O
than O
exploring O
actual O
, O
attainable O
solutions O
for O
improving O
the O
public O
school O
system O
. O

But O
, O
this O
seems O
par O
for O
the O
course O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
“ O
Mommy O
Wars O
” O
: O
Instead O
of O
focusing O
on O
real O
solutions O
and O
changes O
in O
harmful O
infrastructure O
, O
judgement O
is O
tossed O
about O
like O
it O
will O
bring O
magical O
results O
( O
beyond O
anger O
and O
defensiveness O
) O
in O
its O
wake O
. O

Final O
lesson O
? O

You O
’ O
ll O
always O
be O
judged O
for O
pretty O
much O
any O
parenting O
decision O
, O
so O
figure O
out O
what O

The B-B

profiles B-I
21-year-old B-I
Josh B-I
Powell B-I
, B-I
the B-I
product B-I
of B-I
home B-I
schooling B-I
in B-I
rural B-I
Virginia B-I
, B-I
who B-I
paints B-I
an B-I
incredibly B-I
negative B-I
picture B-I
of B-I
the B-I
experience B-I
of B-I
getting B-I
your B-I
education B-I
at B-I
home B-I
. B-I

Powell B-I
tells B-I
of B-I
how B-I
his B-I
parents B-I
, B-I
who B-I
kept B-I
him B-I
and B-I
his B-I
11 B-I
younger B-I
siblings B-I
out B-I
of B-I
public B-I
schools B-I
for B-I
religious B-I
reasons B-I
, B-I
failed B-I
to B-I
provide B-I
a B-I
basic B-I
education B-I
that B-I
left B-I
him B-I
far B-I
behind B-I
other B-I
children B-I
his B-I
age B-I
in B-I
areas B-I
like B-I
math B-I
, B-I
science B-I
, B-I
history B-I
, B-I
and B-I
English B-I
. B-I

One B-I
of B-I
his B-I
siblings B-I
, B-I
currently B-I
at B-I
middle B-I
school B-I
age B-I
, B-I
still B-I
hasn B-I
' B-I
t B-I
learned B-I
to B-I
read B-I
. B-I

Powell B-I
himself B-I
realized B-I
how B-I
far B-I
behind B-I
he B-I
was B-I
falling B-I
and B-I
had B-I
asked B-I
his B-I
parents B-I
to B-I
send B-I
him B-I
to B-I
school B-I
. B-I

When B-I
they B-I
declined B-I
, B-I
he B-I
petitioned B-I
the B-I
school B-I
system B-I
to B-I
let B-I
him B-I
in B-I
, B-I
but B-I
they B-I
declined B-I
too B-I
. B-I

He B-I
eventually B-I
took B-I
remedial B-I
classes B-I
at B-I
a B-I
community B-I
college B-I
and B-I
has B-I
since B-I
transferred B-I
to B-I
Georgetown B-I
University B-I
, B-I
but B-I
he B-I
still B-I
has B-I
a B-I
long B-I
way B-I
to B-I
go B-I
in B-I
catching B-I
up B-I
on B-I
the B-I
years B-I
of B-I
missed B-I
education B-I
. B-I

His B-I
father B-I
, B-I
Clarence B-I
Powell B-I
, B-I
defends B-I
the B-I
home-school B-I
education B-I
that B-I
Josh B-I
and B-I
his B-I
11 B-I
siblings B-I
have B-I
received B-I
, B-I
and B-I
that B-I
he B-I
has B-I
a B-I
right B-I
to B-I
educate B-I
his B-I
children B-I
any B-I
way B-I
he B-I
sees B-I
fit B-I
without B-I
the B-I
government B-I
interfering B-I
. B-I

And O
in O
that O
aspect O
, O
he O
' O
s O
correct O
: O
According O
to O
Virginia O
law O
, O
parents O
who O
have O
a O
religious O
objection O
can O
opt O
to O
not O
only O
home-school O
their O
children O
but O
to O
do O
so O
without O
any O
government O
oversight O
, O
meaning O
there O
is O
no O
mandatory O
curriculum O
and O
no O
checks O
placed O
on O
the O
family O
to O
ensure O
the O
children O
are O
learning O
at O
an O
appropriate O
level O
. O

The O
Powells O
, O
of O
course O
, O
are O
just O
on O
case O
of O
a O
home-schooling O
family O
, O
but O
Josh O
thinks O
they O
are O
other O
kids O
like O
him O
. O

“ O
Who O
knows O
how O
many O
of O
these O
families O
are O
out O
there O
? O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
think O
my O
family O
is O
the O
worst-case O
scenario O
, O
” O
he O
told O
the O
Post O
. O

“ O
It O
’ O
s O
the O
isolation O
that O
allows O
it O
to O
exist O
. O
" O

But C-B
there C-I
is C-I
also C-I
a C-I
case C-I
to C-I
be C-I
made C-I
for C-I
parents C-I
who C-I
wish C-I
to C-I
home-school C-I
their C-I
children C-I
. C-I

Sometimes P-B
local P-I
public P-I
schools P-I
are P-I
themselves P-I
doing P-I
a P-I
poor P-I
job P-I
of P-I
educating P-I
students P-I
. P-I

Some P-B
parents P-I
feel P-I
that P-I
public P-I
schools P-I
will P-I
contradict P-I
the P-I
religious P-I
values P-I
they P-I
are P-I
attempting P-I
to P-I
teach P-I
their P-I
kids P-I
. P-I

And O
due O
to O
cost O
, O
location O
, O
waiting O
lists O
, O
and O
other O
issues O
, O
sometimes O
Catholic O
school O
or O
another O
private O
school O
is O
not O
an O
option O
( O
though O
home O
schooling O
versus O
Catholic O
schools O
has O
been O
a O
whole O
other O
debate O
) O
. O

And P-B
it P-I
is P-I
entirely P-I
possible P-I
that P-I
some P-I
children P-I
might P-I
receive P-I
a P-I
better P-I
education P-I
at P-I
home P-I
than P-I
they P-I
would P-I
in P-I
any P-I
of P-I
the P-I
available P-I
schools P-I
they P-I
could P-I
attend P-I
. P-I

Both O
sides O
of O
this O
debate O
have O
a O
compelling O
case O
. O

Still O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
should O
be O
some O
oversight O
to O
prevent O
children O
from O
falling O
through O
the O
cracks O
. O

Parents O
should O
have O
a O
right O
to O
raise O
their O
children O
any O
way O
they O
wish O
, O
but O
when O
they O
are O
failing O
to O
provide O
even O
the O
most O
basic O
elementary O
skills O
and O
knowledge O
they O
are O
depriving O
their O
kids O
of O
a O
chance O
to O
succeed O
in O
life O
. O

As O
Clarence O
Powell O
himself O
says O
in O
the O
Post O
article O
: O
“ O
A O
good O
education O
is O
not O
an O
option O
. O

It O
’ O
s O
essential O
. O

You O
basically O
get O
one O
opportunity O
to O
do O
it O
. O

If O
you O
come O
out O
on O
the O
other O
side O
deficient O
, O
it O
’ O
s O
hard O
to O
make O
up O
for O
that O
. O

If O
you O
’ O
re O
a O
loving O
parent O
, O
the O
last O
thing O
you O
want O
to O
do O
is O
create O
a O
situation O
where O
your O
children O
are O
limited O
or O
hindered O
. O
” O

Unfortunately O
, O
as O
Josh O
Powell O
' O
s O
experience O
shows O
, O
sometimes O
even O
parents O
who O
want O
to O
do O
the O
best O
they O
can O
for O
their O
children O
may O
not O
succeed O
. O

Though O
the O
state O
must O
respect O
a O
parent O
' O
s O
right O
to O
offer O
an O
education O
consistent O
with O
their O
religious O
beliefs O
, O
sometimes O
maybe O
a O
parent O
needs O
to O
respect O
the O
expertise O
of O
others O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
determining O
what O
makes O
a O
quality O
education O
. O

As O
the O
elder O
Powell O
says O
, O
the O
failure O
to O
do O
so O
can O
be O
incredibly O
difficult O
for O
a O
child O
to O
overcome O
. O

As B-B
a B-I

that B-I
sent B-I
her B-I
son B-I
to B-I
private B-I
schools B-I
, B-I
I B-I
feel B-I
this B-I
is B-I
totally B-I
wrong B-I
for B-I
her B-I

this B-I

My O

I O
( O
my O
parents O

) O
sacrificed O

As O
far O

go O
, O
WOW O
are O
you O
sure O
that O
your O
child O
will O
come O
home O
to O
you O
tonight O
? O
? O
? O
? O

I C-B
would C-I
NEVER C-I
put C-I
my C-I
child C-I
in C-I
a C-I
public C-I
school C-I
system C-I
if C-I
I C-I
could C-I
place C-I
them C-I
in C-I
a C-I
private C-I

So O
, O
come O
up O
with O
a O
different O
way O
to O
make O
the O

in O
better O
shape O

My B-B

God P-I

I O

Over O
the O
past O
three O
years O
, O
the O
Department O
for O
International O
Development O
( O
DFID O
) O
has O
made O
the O
controversial O
move O
to O
support O
low-cost O
private O
schools O
in O
some O
countries O
, O
such O
as O
Nigeria O
, O
Ghana O
, O
or O
Pakistan O
, O
where O
public O
education O
systems O
are O
in O
desperate O
need O
of O
investment O
. O

In O
doing O
this O
, O
the O
DFID O
is O
following O
in O
the O
ideological O
footsteps O
of O
the O
World O
Bank O
. O

Indeed O
, O
a O
recent O
DFID O
Guidance O
Note O
on O
low-cost O
private O
schools O
argues O
that O
such O
schools O
have O
a O
key O
role O
to O
play O
in O
expanding O
education O
provision O
, O
despite O
acknowledging O
the O
fact O
that O
“ O
there O
is O
still O
a O
lack O
of O
data O
and O
comparative O
analysis O
on O
education O
outcomes O
to O
assess O
value O
for O
money O
” O
. O

This O
begs O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
or O
not O
is O
it O
a O
good O
use O
of O
public O
money O
from O
UK O
taxpayers O
to O
invest O
speculatively O
in O
for-profit O
private O
schools O
in O
poor O
countries O
? O

Low-cost O
private O
schools O
thrive O
in O
very O
particular O
contexts O
; O
for O
example O
, O
they O
flourish O
in O
illegal O
slum O
settlements O
in O
marginal O
urban O
areas O
, O
where O
governments O
fail O
to O
provide O
public O
schools O
because O
they O
do O
not O
recognise O
the O
settlements O
. O

Yet O
most O
slum O
dwellers O
would O
much O
prefer O
their O
governments O
to O
open O
schools O
. O

Low-cost O
private O
schools O
are O
also O
evident O
in O
other O
contexts O
: O
for O
example O
, O
where O
government O
services O
are O
largely O
absent O
, O
such O
as O
in O
rural O
Pakistan O
. O

Simple O
analysis O
shows O
that O
this O
is O
the O
result O
of O
the O
government O
failing O
to O
invest O
in O
education O
. O

Pakistan O
spends O
only O
2 O
. O
4% O
of O
its O
gross O
domestic O
product O
( O
GDP O
) O
on O
education O
against O
a O
benchmark O
of O
good O
practice O
of O
6% O
of O
GDP O
. O

In O
this O
context O
DFID O
ought O
to O
be O
making O
the O
case O
for O
increased O
domestic O
investment O
, O
as O
it O
is O
the O
only O
sustainable O
solution O
. O

These P-B
low-cost P-I
private P-I
schools P-I
share P-I
a P-I
common P-I
thread P-I
in P-I
that P-I
they P-I
extract P-I
a P-I
profit P-I
from P-I
the P-I
fees P-I
received P-I
, P-I
by P-I
either P-I
employing P-I
teachers P-I
who P-I
lack P-I
training P-I
and P-I
/ P-I
or P-I
qualifications P-I
, P-I
or P-I
by P-I
paying P-I
teachers P-I
much P-I
lower P-I
salaries P-I
than P-I
those P-I
earned P-I
by P-I
teachers P-I
in P-I
government P-I
schools P-I
. P-I

In P-I
India P-I
, P-I
for P-I
example P-I
, P-I
low-cost P-I
, P-I
private P-I
schools P-I
often P-I
pay P-I
less P-I
than P-I
one P-I
fifth P-I
of P-I
a P-I
teacher P-I
' P-I
s P-I
salary P-I
. P-I

Typically P-I
teachers P-I
are P-I
given P-I
short-term P-I
contracts P-I
; P-I
they P-I
can P-I
be P-I
hired P-I
and P-I
fired P-I
at P-I
the P-I
whim P-I
of P-I
the P-I
private P-I
provider P-I
: P-I
this P-I
has P-I
dangerous P-I
systemic P-I
effects P-I
on P-I
the P-I
status P-I
of P-I
teachers P-I
and P-I
the P-I
credibility P-I
of P-I
the P-I
teaching P-I
profession P-I
. P-I

UK O
aid O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
focused O
on O
ending O
extreme O
poverty O
and O
support O
for O
low-cost O
private O
schools O
inherently O
contradicts O
this O
; O
instead O
, O
such O
schools O
actually O
exacerbate O
inequality O
. O

DFID O
concedes O
that O
in O
India O
, O
“ O
no O
schools O
charging O
below O
$8 O
are O
able O
to O
perform O
well O
” O
. O

For O
parents O
with O
four O
children O
, O
living O
on O
a O
dollar O
a O
day O
, O
paying O
$8 O
or O
more O
per O
child O
per O
month O
consumes O
more O
than O
their O
entire O
income O
. O

In O
such O
contexts O
, O
parents O
may O
choose O
to O
send O
just O
one O
child O
to O
the O
low-cost O
school O
; O
and O
usually O
boys O
are O
prioritised O
, O
thereby O
excluding O
girls O
and O
children O
with O
disabilities O
. O

DFID O
has O
found O
that O
: O
“ O
Evidence O
does O
suggest O
that O
there O
are O
serious O
equity O
and O
choice O
barriers O
associated O
with O
the O
growth O
of O
low O
cost O
private O
schools O
” O
, O
yet O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
these O
concerns O
are O
not O
enough O
to O
stop O
new O
and O
further O
DFID O
investments O
. O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
the O
biggest O
gains O
in O
education O
occurred O
when O
governments O
eliminated O
user O
fees O
to O
deliver O
on O
the O
right O
to O
education O
, O
leading O
to O
tens O
of O
millions O
of O
children O
enrolling O
in O
school O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
and O
supporting O
low-cost O
private O
schools O
mocks O
the O
importance O
of O
that O
evidence O
. O

A O
recent O
survey O
in O
Ghana O
found O
that O
of O
450 O
children O
enrolled O
in O
low-cost O
, O
private O
schools O
, O
449 O
were O
previously O
enrolled O
in O
government-subsidised O
schools O
– O
those O
schools O
that O
will O
now O
suffer O
as O
a O
result O
of O
poor O
investment O
. O

Even O
private O
schools O
that O
charge O
the O
lowest O
fees O
will O
not O
help O
extend O
access O
to O
the O
57 O
million O
children O
not O
in O
school O
today O
. O

Proponents R-B
of R-I
low-cost R-I
, R-I
private R-I
schools R-I
argue R-I
that R-I
privatised R-I
schools R-I
offer R-I
a R-I
model R-I
of R-I
higher R-I
educational R-I
quality R-I
; R-I
but R-I
it R-I
is R-I
here R-I
that R-I
the R-I
evidence R-I
is R-I
highly R-I
contested R-I
and R-I
inconclusive R-I
. R-I

Proponents F-B
tend F-I
to F-I
be F-I
highly F-I
selective F-I
in F-I
quoting F-I
what F-I
is F-I
often F-I
flawed F-I
, F-I
and F-I
superficial F-I
research F-I
about F-I
improved F-I
learning F-I
outcomes F-I
. F-I

The F-I
biggest F-I
flaw F-I
is F-I
that F-I
most F-I
comparative F-I
studies F-I
fail F-I
to F-I
control F-I
for F-I
the F-I
socio-economic F-I
status F-I
of F-I
children F-I
as F-I
well F-I
as F-I
the F-I
self-evident F-I
motivation F-I
of F-I
parents F-I
. F-I

The F-I
latter F-I
point F-I
is F-I
crucial F-I
, F-I
as F-I
parents F-I
who F-I
opt F-I
to F-I
pay F-I
have F-I
prioritised F-I
education F-I
in F-I
their F-I
households F-I
and F-I
will F-I
provide F-I
a F-I
more F-I
supportive F-I
home F-I
environment F-I
– F-I
which F-I
is F-I
a F-I
key F-I
determinant F-I
of F-I
educational F-I
success F-I
. F-I

Even F-I
if F-I
there F-I
was F-I
some F-I
marginal F-I
evidence F-I
of F-I
an F-I
increase F-I
in F-I
gain F-I
of F-I
quality F-I
, F-I
it F-I
is F-I
questionable F-I
as F-I
to F-I
whether F-I
or F-I
not F-I
this F-I
could F-I
be F-I
retained F-I
on F-I
a F-I
larger F-I
scale F-I
. F-I

Furthermore F-I
, F-I
and F-I
there F-I
is F-I
no F-I
evidence F-I
to F-I
suggest F-I
that F-I
the F-I
“ F-I
competition F-I
effect F-I
” F-I
of F-I
low-cost F-I
private F-I
schools F-I
helps F-I
to F-I
aid F-I
in F-I
the F-I
process F-I

in F-I
the F-I
quality F-I

public F-I

( F-I
in F-I
fact F-I
, F-I
private F-I
schools F-I
do F-I
the F-I

The O
narrative O
surrounding O
the O
causality O
of O
any O
( O
flawed O
) O
claims O
of O
difference O
in O
learning O
outcomes O
tends O
to O
relate O
to O
teacher O
attendance O
and O
school O
accountability O
. O

The O
proponents O
of O
privatised O
education O
argue O
that O
private O
schools O
make O
a O
difference O
by O
ensuring O
that O
teachers O
are O
in O
the O
classroom O
and O
that O
schools O
are O
accountable O
to O
parents O
. O

If O
so O
, O
the O
coherent O
response O
should O
be O
to O
invest O
in O
teachers O
within O
the O
public O
system O
: O
expanding O
and O
improving O
training O
and O
support O
, O
making O
school O
inspectorates O
work O
effectively O
and O
strengthening O
school O
management O
committees O
. O

Such O
investments O
yield O
systemic O
, O
nation-wide O
returns O
in O
improving O
quality O
– O
a O
much O
more O
strategic O
and O
effective O
use O
of O
public O
money O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
most O
DFID O
funding O
for O
education O
is O
still O
spent O
on O
such O
efforts O
. O

We O
desperately O
need O
to O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
public O
schools O
, O
and O
this O
issue O
needs O
concerted O
attention O
and O
support O
. O

We O
need O
to O
mobilise O
new O
resourcing O
for O
education O
, O
securing O
at O
least O
6% O
of O
GDP O
and O
20% O
of O
national O
budgets O
. O

We O
need O
to O
support O
progressive O
macro-economic O
policies O
over O
austerity O
and O
we O
urgently O
need O
to O
expand O
the O
domestic O
tax O
base O
of O
low O
income O
countries O
, O
for O
example O
by O
ending O
the O
unnecessary O
and O
often O
corrupt O
tax O
holidays O
given O
to O
big O
multinational O
companies O
. O

Lost O
revenues O
from O
tax O
exemptions O
given O
away O
unnecessarily O
by O
governments O
add O
up O
to O
$138 O
billion O
annually- O
which O
is O
more O
than O
enough O
to O
ensure O
we O
deliver O
on O
the O
full O
education O
and O
wider O
development O
agenda O
in O
every O
country O
. O

For O
many O
years O
the O
DFID O
has O
been O
a O
global O
leader O
in O
supporting O
sector-wide O
public O
education O
reform O
through O
the O
Global O
Partnership O
for O
Education O
. O

Let O
us O
hope O
they O
do O
not O
break O
the O
broad O
global O
consensus O
on O
education O
reform O
by O
pursuing O

Lately O
I O

been O
thinking O
more O
seriously O
about O
my O
single-sex O
education O
after O
devouring O
Sheryl O
Sandberg O
' O

now O
infamous O
Lean O
In O
. O

One O
of O
Sandberg O
' O
s O
bigger O
points O
is O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
long O
before O
women O
are O
in O
careers O
, O
graduate O
school O
, O
or O
even O
college O
, O
in O
order O
to O
teach O
them O
how O
to O
lean O
in O
. O

Given O
this O
focus O
on O
childhood O
and O
adolescence O
I O
' O
m O
surprised O
that O
all-girls O
' O
schools O
haven O
' O
t O
been O
discussed O
in O
the O
same O
breath O
as O
Sandberg O
' O
s O
long-term O
project O
. O

Based P-B
on P-I
my P-I
experience P-I
, P-I
and P-I
my P-I
research P-I
on P-I
competition P-I
, P-I
gender P-I
, P-I
and P-I
education P-I
, P-I
promoting P-I
all-girls P-I
' P-I
education P-I
in P-I
the P-I
grade P-I
school P-I
years P-I
is P-I
a P-I
useful P-I
strategy P-I
to P-I
raise P-I
women P-I
who P-I
know P-I
how P-I
to P-I
lean P-I
in P-I
throughout P-I
life P-I
. P-I

In O
Lean O
In O
Sandberg O
explains O
that O
as O
a O
child O
she O
used O
to O
organize O
all O
the O
neighborhood O
children O
and O
tell O
them O
what O
to O
do O
. O

But O
to O
this O
day O
she O
cringes O
when O
her O
siblings O
tell O
this O
story O
because O
: O
" O
When O
a O
girl O
tries O
to O
lead O
, O
she O
is O
often O
labeled O
bossy O
. O

Boys O
are O
seldom O
called O
bossy O
because O
a O
boy O
taking O
the O
role O
of O
a O
boss O
does O
not O
surprise O
or O
offend O
. O
" O

My O
professional O
, O
adult O
self O
certainly O
understands O
this O
sentiment O
, O
but O
my O
13-year-old O
self O
would O
have O
been O
confused O
. O

At O
13 O
I O
would O
have O
said O
that O
of O
course O
girls O
need O
to O
be O
bossy O
-- O
who O
else O
would O
lead O
? O

I O
always O
thought O
of O
girls O
as O
the O
sports O
stars O
and O
the O
valedictorians O
, O
because O
at O
my O
school O
they O
were O
. O

I B-B
took B-I
this B-I
attitude B-I
with B-I
me B-I
into B-I

, B-I

building B-I

Some B-I
of B-I

The B-I
boys B-I
came B-I
over B-I

, B-I
classes B-I
where B-I
I B-I
always B-I

myself B-I

my B-I

were B-I
clearly B-I
infringing B-I
on B-I
my B-I
territory B-I
and B-I
I B-I
made B-I
sure B-I
I B-I

That B-I

translated B-I
when B-I

where B-I
I B-I
righteously B-I
covered B-I

I O
quickly O

that O

We O

the O
hard-to-measure O
notion O
that O

President O

once O
said O
, O
“ O
To O

to O
educate O
a O
menace O

” O

This O
is O
an O
ideal O
that O
is O
being O
espoused O
by O
homeschooling O
parents O
who O
no O

wish O
to O

Because P-B

moral P-I

the P-I
greater P-I
is P-I
the P-I
belief P-I

that P-I
they P-I

their P-I

out P-I

effect P-I
on P-I
both P-I
their P-I
lives P-I

their P-I

It B-B
is B-I
ironic B-I
to B-I
say B-I
the B-I
least B-I
that B-I
in B-I
Dr B-I
. B-I
Brian B-I
Ray B-I
’ B-I
s B-I
California B-I
study B-I
, B-I
around B-I
92 B-I
percent B-I
of B-I
public B-I
school B-I
superintendents B-I
harbors B-I
the B-I
erroneous B-I
notions B-I
that B-I
homeschooled B-I
kids B-I
are B-I
socially B-I
impaired B-I
, B-I
emotionally B-I
unstable B-I
, B-I
and B-I
“ B-I

” B-I
of B-I
their B-I
community B-I

the B-I
world B-I

. B-I

These B-I
beliefs B-I
on B-I
the B-I
effects B-I
of B-I

on B-I

have B-I
led B-I

numerous B-I

Rather B-I
than B-I
prove B-I
these B-I
beliefs B-I
to B-I
be B-I
correct B-I
, B-I
they B-I
show B-I
a B-I

Why O
are O
public O
educators O
and O
superintendents O
concerned O
about O
the O
growing O
number O
of O
parents O
who O
are O
homeschooling O
their O
kids O
? O

The O
most O
obvious O
reason O
is O
that O
with O
fewer O
students O
enrolling O
in O
public O
school O
, O
there O
will O
be O
lesser O
funds O
going O
into O
the O

Teachers O
, O
on O
the O

, O
are O
afraid O
that O
they O

lose O
their O

to O
more O
effective O

who O
are O
not O
even O

. O

It R-B
is R-I
not R-I
surprising R-I
, R-I
therefore R-I
, R-I
that R-I
they R-I
would R-I
constantly R-I
put R-I
down R-I
homeschooling R-I
as R-I
not R-I
an R-I
effective R-I
form R-I
of R-I
education R-I
, R-I
specifically R-I
targeting R-I
the R-I
“ R-I
lack R-I
of R-I
social R-I
skills R-I
” R-I
as R-I
a R-I
main R-I
point R-I
against R-I
homeschoolers R-I
. R-I

However F-B
, F-I
Dr F-I
. F-I
Thomas F-I

debunked F-I
these F-I
assumptions F-I
when F-I
he F-I
did F-I
a F-I

on F-I
homeschooled F-I
kids F-I

He F-I
made F-I

Public P-B
schools P-I
argue P-I
that P-I
their P-I
kids P-I
are P-I
better P-I
socialized P-I
. P-I

In P-I
reality P-I
, P-I
children P-I
and P-I
teens P-I
are P-I
locked P-I
behind P-I
gates P-I
on P-I
campus P-I
, P-I
are P-I
segregated P-I
by P-I
age P-I
, P-I
are P-I
forced P-I
to P-I
remain P-I
silent P-I
in P-I
class P-I
unless P-I
called P-I
by P-I
the P-I
teacher P-I
, P-I
and P-I
whose P-I
schedules P-I
are P-I
determined P-I
by P-I
the P-I
blare P-I
of P-I
school P-I
bells P-I
. P-I

In P-B
contrast P-I
, P-I
a P-I
homeschooler P-I
’ P-I
s P-I
“ P-I
classroom P-I
” P-I
is P-I
the P-I
world P-I
around P-I
him P-I
/ P-I
her P-I
. P-I

Parents P-I
don P-I
’ P-I
t P-I
just P-I
limit P-I
teaching P-I
their P-I
children P-I
in P-I
the P-I
living P-I
or P-I
dining P-I
room P-I
. P-I

They P-I
hold P-I
lessons P-I
in P-I
parks P-I
, P-I
libraries P-I
or P-I
museums P-I
. P-I

They P-I
take P-I
weekly P-I
field P-I
trips P-I
to P-I
places P-I
of P-I
interest P-I
in P-I
the P-I
community P-I
, P-I
including P-I
churches P-I
, P-I
colleges P-I
, P-I
hospitals P-I

departments P-I
, P-I
city P-I
halls P-I
, P-I
and P-I
even P-I
repair P-I
shops P-I
. P-I

Indeed P-I
, P-I
parents P-I
ensure P-I
that P-I
their P-I
kids P-I
are P-I
able P-I
to P-I
interact P-I
with P-I
people P-I
of P-I
all P-I
ages P-I
, P-I
and P-I
not P-I
just P-I
with P-I
their P-I
peers P-I
. P-I

A O
second O
point O
to O
consider O
is O
that O
there O
is O
an O
obvious O
discrepancy O
between O
public O
school O
educators O
and O
homeschoolers O
on O
what O
traits O
define O
successful O
socialization O
. O

In O
a O
study O
conducted O
by O
Dr O
. O
Michael O
Mitchell O
, O
traits O
for O
successful O
socialization O
in O
students O
include O
popularity O
among O
peers O
, O
aggressive O
competitiveness O
, O
pride O
and O
self-confidence O
, O
and O
a O
drive O
toward O
materialism O
. O

In P-B
contrast P-I
, P-I
homeschoolers P-I
want P-I
their P-I
children P-I
to P-I
focus P-I
on P-I
building P-I
character P-I
and P-I
integrity P-I
, P-I
developing P-I
a P-I
sense P-I
of P-I
responsibility P-I
, P-I
and P-I
respect P-I
toward P-I
others P-I
– P-I
ideals P-I
of P-I
Christian P-I
living P-I
. P-I

It P-I
certainly P-I
is P-I
not P-I
surprising P-I
, P-I
therefore P-I
, P-I
that P-I
Christian P-I
parents P-I
and P-I
those P-I
who P-I
have P-I
strong P-I
belief P-I
systems P-I
choose P-I
to P-I
homeschool P-I
their P-I
children P-I
instead P-I
of P-I
their P-I
developing P-I
questionable P-I
values P-I
in P-I
the P-I
public P-I
school P-I
system P-I
. P-I

Lastly P-B
, P-I
it P-I
is P-I
important P-I
to P-I
mention P-I
that P-I
these P-I
same P-I
negative P-I
values P-I
in P-I
public P-I
school P-I
are P-I
what P-I
is P-I
causing P-I
the P-I
increase P-I
in P-I
delinquent P-I
behavior P-I
, P-I
including P-I
drug P-I
abuse P-I
, P-I
sexual P-I
promiscuity P-I
, P-I
violence P-I
, P-I
emotional P-I
and P-I
psychological P-I
disorders P-I
, P-I
just P-I
to P-I
name P-I
a P-I
few P-I
. P-I

The P-I
reason P-I
for P-I
this P-I
is P-I
that P-I
kids P-I
and P-I
teens P-I
are P-I
getting P-I
their P-I
“ P-I
socialization P-I
education P-I
” P-I
from P-I
other P-I
adults P-I
and P-I
their P-I
peers P-I
, P-I
without P-I
the P-I
guidance P-I
of P-I
their P-I
parents P-I
. P-I

Not P-I
surprisingly P-I
, P-I
delinquent P-I
and P-I
antisocial P-I
behaviors P-I
are P-I
practically P-I
non-existent P-I
in P-I
homeschooled P-I
children P-I
. P-I

I C-B
' C-I

on C-I
the C-I
homeschool C-I
side C-I
of C-I
the C-I

That O

, O
I O
don O
' O

believe O
it O
' O
s O
the O
best O
in O
every O

case O

For O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
argument O

I O
' O

referring O
to O
homeschooling O
as O
any O
kind O

a O

anything O

But O
here O
are O
my O
reasons O
: O
1 O
. O

The O
primary O
responsibility O
of O
the O
education O
of O
a O
child O
rests O
on O
the O
parents O

Children O
are O

by O
the O

and O
the O
government O
cannot O
tell O
people O
how O
to O
raise O
their O
children O

Some O
of O
you O
with O
different O
political O
backgrounds O
may O
disagree O
, O
but O
this O
is O
what O
I O
believe O
. O

Ideological O
reasons O
for O
homeschooling O
are O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
completely O
legitimate O
. O

2 O
. O
) O

Every O
child O
is O
different O
. O

I O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
you O
on O
both O
sides O
saying O
this O
too O
. O

Homeschooling P-B
allows P-I
you P-I
to P-I
tailor P-I
your P-I
education P-I
to P-I
whatever P-I
way P-I
helps P-I
you P-I
learn P-I
best P-I
. P-I

My B-B
school B-I
has B-I
a B-I
heavy B-I
focus B-I
on B-I
writing B-I
, B-I
and B-I
using B-I
essays B-I
. B-I

This B-I
really B-I
helps B-I
me B-I
retain B-I
the B-I
information B-I
, B-I
and B-I
so B-I
it B-I
' B-I
s B-I
wonderful B-I
for B-I
me B-I
. B-I

Other O
schools O
have O
other O
methods O
. O

But P-B
when P-I
you P-I
put P-I
30 P-I
kids P-I
in P-I
one P-I
classroom P-I
, P-I
it P-I
becomes P-I
very P-I
difficult P-I
to P-I
teach P-I
them P-I
all P-I
individually P-I
. P-I

3 O
. O
) O

The P-B
public P-I
school P-I
system P-I
in P-I
most P-I
places P-I
is P-I
out P-I
of P-I
control P-I
. P-I

I O
know O
some O
of O
you O
are O
saying O
, O
" O
Well O
, O
in O
MY O
public O
school O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
. O
. O

. O
" O
and O
that O
' O

great O

Maybe O
for O
the O
people O
who O
live O
in O
that O
neighborhood O
, O
homeschooling O
isn O
' O
t O
the O
better O
option O
. O

But B-B
I B-I
had B-I
to B-I
go B-I
to B-I
my B-I
local B-I
public B-I
school B-I
to B-I
take B-I
the B-I
PSAT B-I
and B-I
someone B-I
was B-I
getting B-I
arrested B-I
as B-I
we B-I
were B-I
leaving B-I
. B-I

So P-B
in P-I
some P-I
cases P-I
there P-I
' P-I

a P-I
safety P-I
issue P-I

In O
other O

it O
' O
s O
what O
kids O
will O
hear O

I O

This O

the O
things O

this P-I
is P-I

for P-I
the P-I

I O
have O
friends O
I O
can O
honestly O
call O

So O
those O
are O

could O
go O

I O
won O

I O
know O
some O
AWESOME O

WONDERFUL O
people O
who O
go O

The O
point O
is O
not O
to O
fling O
those O

forth O
, O

to O
have O
a O

discussion O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
I O
was O
looking O
at O
middle O
schools O
for O
my O
daughter O
, O
I O
heard O
about O
a O
school O
that O
sounded O
lovely O
except O
for O
one O
thing O
: O
it O
had O
a O
policy O
of O
separating O
math O
classes O
by O
gender O
. O

Having O
reported O
on O
a O
vogue O
for O
single-sex O
classrooms O
in O
the O
nineties O
, O
I O
knew O
the O
rationale O
: O
girls O
and O
boys O
distract O
one O
another O
; O
girls O
need O
extra O
ego O
boosts O
and O
a O
gentle O
approach O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
studying O
math O
and O
science O
. O

I O
’ O
d O
never O
found O
the O
arguments O
especially O
persuasive O
. O

But O
what O
really O
brought O
me O
up O
short O
was O
imagining O
how O
I O
would O
explain O
the O
policy O
to O
my O
daughter O
, O
whose O
best O
friends O
were O
boys O
. O

Everything O
I O
could O
think O
of O
saying O
sounded O
offensive O
or O
deflating O
or O
dumb O
: O
math O
is O
hard O
for O
girls O
; O
they—that O
is O
, O
you—need O
special O
treatment O
; O
boys O
’ O
and O
girls O
’ O
brains O
are O
different O
; O
pre-algebra O
with O
boys O
in O
the O
room O
is O
just O
too O
exciting—you O
won O
’ O
t O
know O
what O
hit O
you O
! O

If O
we O
’ O
d O
chosen O
an O
all-girls O
’ O
school O
, O
that O
would O
be O
one O
thing O
. O

Those O
schools O
weren O
’ O
t O
founded O
on O
the O
premise O
that O
men O
and O
women O
have O
incompatible O
intellects O
, O
but O
in O
recognition O
of O
what O
were O
often O
limited O
educational O
opportunities O
for O
women O

Their O
origin O

belonged O

the O

and O

continued O

Hogwarts-like O

under O

This O
was O

This O
was O
saying O
we O
believe O
in O
coeducation O

because O
we O
live O
in O

Only O
about O
a O
dozen O
public O
schools O
were O
trying O
them O
in O
2002 O
, O
but O
since O
the O
Department O
of O
Education O
relaxed O
its O
rules O
on O
gender-segregated O
classrooms O
, O
in O
2006 O
, O
about O
five O
hundred O
public O
schools O
across O
the O
country O
have O
adopted O
them O
, O
according O
to O
an O

some R-I

point R-I

real R-I
gains R-I
, R-I
but F-B
often F-I
these F-I
can F-I
be F-I
attributed F-I
to F-I
selection F-I
bias—the F-I
children F-I
involved F-I
were F-I
more F-I
committed F-I

to F-I

She O
thought O

reasonably O
enough O
, O
that O
some O

might O
benefit O
from O
a O
little O
of O
the O

freedom O
. O

What O
has O
changed O
since O
the O
nineties O
is O
the O
notion O
of O
who O
single-sex O
education O
is O
supposed O
to O
help O
most O

Girls O
were O

to O

in O

when O

But O
that O

Now O
segregation O
by O

is O
more O
often O
an O
intervention O
for O

switch O

that O
makes O
you O
wonder O
a O
little O
about O
the O
reliability O

the O
justifications O

“ O
The O

A O

of O
the O
effort O
in O
an O
Idaho O

“ O
In O

When O

” O

And O
there O
’ O
s O
the O
real O
trouble O
with O
this O
single-sex O
approach O
. O

The O
presumptions O
behind O
it O
are O
fusty O

often O
plain O
silly—which O
might O
make O
them O
easy O
for O

them O
to O

I O
think O
that O
the O
superiority O
over O

type O
of O

doesn O
' O

exist O
. O

It O
all O
depends O

person O

I B-B
went B-I
to B-I
public B-I
school B-I
and B-I
was B-I
in B-I
every B-I
club B-I
, B-I
president B-I
of B-I
some B-I
, B-I
and B-I
also B-I
was B-I
in B-I
the B-I
Student B-I
Body B-I
Presidency B-I
. B-I

Public P-B
schooling P-I
creates P-I
lots P-I
of P-I
oppurtunities P-I
to P-I
meet P-I
large P-I
groups P-I
of P-I
people P-I
. P-I

This O
was O
good O
for O
me O
because O
my O
type O
of O
personality O
is O
to O
lead O
people O
, O
though O
usually O
through O
manipulation O
bargains O
and O
other O
types O
of O
persuasion O
, O
not O
because O
im O
a O
strong O
leader O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
I O
signed O
up O
for O
homechooling O
so O
that O
I O
could O
launch O
myself O
into O
college O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
done O
regular O
homeschooling O
though O
. O

So O
I O
don O
' O
t O
have O
grounds O
on O
it O
. O

But O
I O
live O
in O
a O
community O
that O
could O
be O
considered O
a O
little O
rednecked O
and O
the O
extremes O
are O
a O
little O
more O
common O
here O
. O

But O
, O
hey O
, O
my O
first O
year O
as O
a O
full O
time O
student O
in O
college O
was O
at O
13 O
, O
which O
I O
' O
m O
not O
anyore O
, O
but O
i O
feel O
like O
im O
behind O
because O
all O
of O
the O
General O
facts O
about O
things O
you O
learn O
in O
regular O
school O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
. O

Where O
you O
could O
study O
the O
World O
in O
Highschool O
, O
, O
I O
might O
spend O
two O
years O
just O
to O
get O
an O
overview O
of O
the O
United O

History O
in O
college O
. O

Another P-B
point P-I
to P-I
be P-I
made P-I
is P-I
your P-I
peers P-I
, P-I
if P-I
your P-I
a P-I
introvert P-I
, P-I
than P-I
it P-I
doesn P-I
' P-I
t P-I
really P-I
matter P-I
which P-I
school P-I
you P-I
go P-I
to P-I
on P-I
this P-I
point P-I
, P-I
If P-I
you P-I
are P-I
an P-I
extrovert P-I
then P-I
here P-I
are P-I
the P-I
facts P-I
: P-I
when P-I
public P-I
school P-I
was P-I
created P-I
, P-I
many P-I
people P-I
grasped P-I
it P-I
to P-I
recieve P-I
a P-I
free P-I
education P-I
and P-I
now P-I
it P-I
is P-I
a P-I
part P-I
of P-I
everyday P-I
life P-I
, P-I
at P-I
least P-I
it P-I
is P-I
in P-I
the P-I
United P-I
States P-I
, P-I
that P-I
means P-I
that P-I
there P-I
are P-I
a P-I
lot P-I
of P-I
poeple P-I
in P-I
public P-I
school P-I
and P-I
so P-I
it P-I
would P-I
be P-I
great P-I
for P-I
an P-I
extrovert P-I
. P-I

On P-B
the P-I
other P-I
side P-I
Homechoolers P-I
, P-I
depending P-I
on P-I
where P-I
you P-I
live P-I
and P-I
possibly P-I
how P-I
you P-I
are P-I
homeschooled P-I
, P-I
have P-I
homeschooling P-I
groups P-I
which P-I
not P-I
only P-I
have P-I
a P-I
large P-I
group P-I
of P-I
people P-I
, P-I
though P-I
usually P-I
smaller P-I
thatn P-I
the P-I
public P-I
school P-I
, P-I
but P-I
have P-I
the P-I
freedom P-I
of P-I
doing P-I
things P-I
togethermore P-I
often P-I
, P-I
Time P-I
schedules P-I
are P-I
more P-I
flexible P-I
and P-I
if P-I
you P-I
really P-I
wanted P-I
to P-I
you P-I
could P-I
skip P-I
a P-I
whole P-I
day P-I
of P-I
school P-I
in P-I
the P-I
middle P-I
of P-I
the P-I
wek P-I
just P-I
to P-I
hand P-I
out P-I

I B-I

high B-I

. B-I

I C-B
highly C-I
recommend C-I
a C-I
co-ed C-I
school C-I
. C-I

Now O
, O
there O
are O
pros O
and O
cons O
for O
each O
. O

But P-B
I P-I
feel P-I
that P-I
the P-I
co-ed P-I
school P-I
is P-I
more P-I
" P-I
natural P-I
" P-I
and P-I
its P-I
pros P-I
outweigh P-I
its P-I
cons P-I
more P-I
than P-I
the P-I
all-girls P-I
school P-I
. P-I

. O

. O

But O
that O
' O
s O
just O
my O
opinion O
. O

The B-B
major B-I
thing B-I
was B-I
that B-I
I B-I
always B-I
felt B-I
like B-I
the B-I
presence B-I
of B-I
boys B-I
would B-I
have B-I
made B-I
the B-I
girls B-I
far B-I
less B-I
bitchy B-I
( B-I
as B-I
they B-I
did B-I
in B-I
my B-I
co-ed B-I
school B-I
experiences B-I
) B-I
. B-I

I O
know O
that O
seems O
like O
such O
a O
minor O
gripe O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
you O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
be O
surrounded O
by O
the O
bullshit O
girls O
can O
concoct O
amongst O
each O
other O
when O
there O
are O
no O
boys O
to O
" O
restrict O
" O
certain O
behaviours O
. O

. O

. O

and P-B
I P-I
actually P-I
do P-I
feel P-I
like P-I
co-ed P-I
schools P-I
develop P-I
a P-I
girl P-I
better P-I
socially P-I
and P-I
emotionally P-I
than P-I
all-girls P-I
schools P-I
, P-I
just P-I
from P-I
the P-I
mere P-I
fact P-I
that P-I
a P-I
girl P-I
will P-I
get P-I
to P-I
interact P-I
with P-I
boys P-I
on P-I
a P-I
daily P-I
basis P-I
. P-I

Another P-B
thing P-I
that P-I
I P-I
feel P-I
parents P-I
should P-I
be P-I
aware P-I
of P-I
: P-I
I P-I
personally P-I
found P-I
that P-I
girls P-I
who P-I
attend P-I
all-girls P-I
school P-I
will P-I
go P-I
out P-I
more P-I
to P-I
actually P-I
meet P-I
boys P-I
than P-I
girls P-I
in P-I
co-ed P-I
schools P-I
. P-I

What P-I
I P-I
mean P-I
by P-I
this P-I
is P-I
, P-I
girls P-I
in P-I
co-ed P-I
schools P-I
will P-I
hang P-I
out P-I
with P-I
boys P-I
from P-I
school P-I
( P-I
inside P-I
and P-I
outside P-I
of P-I
school P-I
) P-I
, P-I
yes P-I
, P-I
but P-I
the P-I
fact P-I
is P-I
: P-I
they P-I
know P-I
these P-I
boys P-I
. P-I

They P-I
went P-I
to P-I
school P-I
with P-I
them P-I
. P-I

They P-I
grew P-I
up P-I
with P-I
them P-I
. P-I

Surely P-I
as P-I
a P-I
parent P-I
you P-I
' P-I
d P-I
feel P-I
more P-I
OK P-I
knowing P-I
that P-I
your P-I
daughter P-I
was P-I
with P-I
someone P-I
she P-I
knew P-I
? P-I

Whereas P-B
girls P-I
who P-I
go P-I
to P-I
all-girls P-I
schools P-I
will P-I
hang P-I
out P-I
with P-I
guys P-I
from P-I
another P-I
school P-I
( P-I
maybe P-I
their P-I

Should P-B

There C-B

here C-I

People P-B
generally P-I
do P-I
this P-I
because P-I
they P-I
want P-I
what P-I
is P-I
best P-I
for P-I
their P-I

For P-B

a P-I
good P-I
thing P-I
. P-I

-DOCSTART- -X- -X- -X- O

I O
spent O
the O
last O
four O
years O
of O
my O
life O
in O
a O
private O
, O
catholic O
, O
all O
girls O
college O
preparatory O
high O
school O
and O
while O
one O
may O
say O
that O
I O
missed O
out O
on O
the O
standard O
, O
social O
facets O
of O
a O
typical O
high O
school O
experience O
; O
I C-B
would C-I
argue C-I
till C-I
death C-I
that C-I
my C-I
all C-I
girls C-I
high C-I
school C-I
experience C-I
was C-I
something C-I
I C-I
wouldn C-I
' C-I
t C-I
trade C-I
for C-I
the C-I
world C-I
. C-I

Contrary O
to O
popular O
belief O
, O
the O
500 O
girls O
that O
went O
to O
my O
school O
were O
not O
closeted-bible-loving-anti-social-feminists O
and O
we O
did O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
socialize O
with O
members O
of O
the O
opposite O
sex O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
it O
has O
been O
an O
on-going O
, O
contentious O
issue O
for O
society O
as O
to O
whether O
a O
single-sex O
or O
co-ed O
environment O
provides O
a O
superior O
education O
. O

So O
, O
will O
a O
single-sex O
education O
make O
you O
smarter O
? O

We O
must O
first O
come O
to O
realize O
that O
while O
males O
and O
females O
are O
not O
two O
different O
species O
, O
that O
are O
very O
different O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
learning O
, O
expression O
, O
and O
overall O
being O
. O

And O
so O
, O
one O
can O
argue O
that O
a O
single-sex O
education O
can O
more O
accurately O
focus O
the O
learning O
needs O
of O
the O
targeted O
sex O
; O
but O
does O
that O
secluded O
sex O
suffer O
from O
the O
lack O
of O
the O
opposite O
? O

Many P-B
sociologists P-I
agree P-I
that P-I
females P-I
are P-I
, P-I
" P-I
unable P-I
to P-I
perform P-I
if P-I
they P-I
are P-I
not P-I
at P-I
least P-I
50% P-I
of P-I
a P-I
class P-I
, P-I
they P-I
feel P-I
pressured P-I
by P-I
stereotype P-I
threat P-I
and P-I
the P-I
potential P-I
for P-I
gender P-I
bias P-I
, P-I
and P-I
so P-I
a P-I
100% P-I
same-sex P-I
class P-I
would P-I
seem P-I
to P-I
unlock P-I
the P-I
potential P-I
for P-I
all P-I
females P-I
" P-I
( P-I
Campbell P-I

) P-I
. P-I

From B-B
my B-I
own B-I
experience B-I
, B-I
I B-I
can B-I
vouch B-I
for B-I
the B-I
truth B-I
of B-I
the B-I
previous B-I
statement B-I
. B-I

I B-I
had B-I
classmates B-I
in B-I
high B-I
school B-I
that B-I
flourished B-I
in B-I
an B-I
all-girls B-I
setting B-I
, B-I
by B-I
allowing B-I
themselves B-I
to B-I
say B-I
and B-I
do B-I
things B-I
they B-I
wouldn B-I
' B-I
t B-I
have B-I
done B-I
in B-I
the B-I
company B-I
of B-I
boys B-I
. B-I

I B-I
, B-I
myself B-I
, B-I
felt B-I
more B-I
open B-I
and B-I
confident B-I
to B-I
participate B-I
in B-I
an B-I
all B-I
girls B-I
setting B-I

So O
, O
while O
the O
single-sex O
atmosphere O
allowed O
young O
women O
at O
my O
school O
to O
branch O
out O
and O
express O
themselves O
without O
the O
restriction O
of O
the O
opposite O
sex O
, O
some O
may O
argue O
that O
it O
could O
have O
instilled O
an O
anxiety O

the O

But O
then O
we O
have O
studies O
that O
show O
the O
numbers O

It O
is O
very O
clear O
by O
the O
above O
chart O
that O
both O
sexes O
academically O
benefit O
from O
a O
single-sex O
education O
. O

The O
National O
Foundation O
for O
Educational O
Research O
conducted O
a O
study O
in O
which O
they O
observed O

calculated O
of O

In O

Studies P-B
show P-I
that P-I
women P-I
suffer P-I
from P-I
a P-I
stereotype P-I
threat P-I
in P-I
math P-I
and P-I
science P-I
, P-I
meaning P-I
that P-I
in P-I
the P-I
fields P-I
of P-I
math P-I
and P-I
science P-I
women P-I
are P-I
more P-I
apprehensive P-I
to P-I
perform P-I
due P-I
to P-I
their P-I
perceived P-I
inferiority P-I
to P-I
men P-I
. P-I

Perhaps B-B
that B-I
is B-I
why B-I
girls B-I
at B-I
my B-I
high B-I
school B-I
were B-I
so B-I
confident B-I
in B-I
their B-I
work B-I
, B-I
there B-I
were B-I
no B-I
boys B-I
to B-I
do B-I
better B-I
and B-I
perhaps B-I
this B-I
is B-I
why B-I
women B-I
are B-I
always B-I
found B-I
to B-I
do B-I
better B-I
in B-I
single-sex B-I
school B-I
environments B-I
. B-I

Another O
factor O
in O
this O
issue O
is O
that O
most O
single-sex O
schools O
are O
private O
, O
and O
require O
an O
entrance O
test O
. O

Therefore O
, O
one O
can O
argue O
that O
the O
students O
in O
single-sex O
schools O
are O
already O
at O
an O
advantage O
. O

But O
does O
that O
single-sex O
environment O
only O
further O

intelligence O
of O

A R-B
article R-I
published R-I
by R-I
ABC R-I
News R-I
focuses R-I
on R-I
the R-I
negative R-I
effects R-I
of R-I
single-sex R-I
education R-I
when R-I
it R-I
comes R-I
to R-I
the R-I
social R-I
aspect R-I
. R-I

A R-I
2010 R-I
study R-I
on R-I
two R-I
separate R-I
pre-school R-I
classes R-I
displays R-I
negative R-I
, R-I
social R-I
affects R-I
on R-I
students R-I
, R-I
" R-I
In R-I
one R-I
class R-I
, R-I
the R-I
teacher R-I
used R-I
gender-specific R-I
language R-I
to R-I
address R-I
the R-I
children R-I
. R-I

The R-I
other R-I
teacher R-I
did R-I
not R-I
. R-I

After R-I
just R-I
two R-I
weeks R-I
, R-I
the R-I
researchers R-I
reported R-I
that R-I
children R-I
who R-I
had R-I
the R-I
teacher R-I
using R-I
sex-specific R-I
language R-I
played R-I
less R-I
with R-I
children R-I
of R-I
the R-I
other R-I
sex R-I
. R-I
" R-I

And R-I
so R-I
, R-I
some R-I
may R-I
argue R-I
that R-I
single-sex R-I
education R-I
promotes R-I
gender-issued R-I
stereotypes R-I
. R-I

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
is O
it O
up O
to O
the O
parents O
: O
sacrifice O
your O
child O
' O
s O
appreciation O
and O
cooperation O
with O
the O
opposite O
sex O
for O
a O
more O
specialized O
, O
concentrated O
academic O
environment O
? O

My O
proposed O
solution O
would O
be O
to O
create O
co-ed O
, O
public O
schools O
that O
separate O
the O
sexes O
for O
the O
subjects O
of O
math O
and O
science O
( O
debatably O
the O
two O
hardest O
, O
most O
demanding O
subjects O
taught O
in O
high O
school O
and O
the O
subjects O
that O
evoke O
the O
stereotype O
threat O
) O
and O
create O
co-ed O
environments O
for O
all O
the O
other O
subjects O
. O

Then O
, O
teachers O
could O
focus O
on O
targeting O
the O
needs O
for O
each O
sex O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
math O
and O
science O
, O
and O
incorporate O
both O
males O
and O
females O
for O
all O
other O
aspects O
of O
high O
school O
life O
. O

This O
utopian O
schooling O
system O
would O
essentially O
provide O
the O
best O
of O
both O

The P-B
only P-I
reason P-I

Nowadays O
, O

are O

I C-B
think C-I
mainstreaming C-I
special C-I
education C-I
students C-I
is C-I
wonderful C-I
. C-I

I B-B
have B-I
had B-I
several B-I
of B-I
them B-I
in B-I
my B-I
math B-I
classes B-I
, B-I
and B-I
they B-I
have B-I
generally B-I
been B-I
some B-I
of B-I
the B-I
best B-I
students B-I
. B-I

There R-B
can R-I
be R-I
, R-I
however R-I
, R-I
a R-I
few R-I
road R-I
blocks R-I
for R-I
special R-I
education R-I
students R-I
, R-I
parents R-I
and R-I
teachers R-I
. R-I

Here O
is O
my O
experience O
. O

First R-B
, R-I
students R-I
with R-I
learning R-I
disabilities R-I
tend R-I
to R-I
be R-I
self R-I
conscious R-I
of R-I
the R-I
fact R-I
that R-I
they R-I
have R-I
a R-I
learning R-I
disability R-I
. R-I

As R-I
with R-I
any R-I
generalization R-I
, R-I
there R-I
are R-I
exceptions R-I
to R-I
the R-I
rule R-I
, R-I
but R-I
this R-I
is R-I
what R-I
I R-I
have R-I
seen R-I
. R-I

The R-I
self R-I
consciousness R-I
hinders R-I
students R-I
from R-I
asking R-I
questions R-I
in R-I
class R-I
, R-I
and R-I
therefore R-I
students R-I
get R-I
more R-I
frustrated R-I
by R-I
not R-I
understanding R-I
the R-I
material R-I
. R-I

Traditional R-I
students R-I
also R-I
try R-I
to R-I
refrain R-I
from R-I
asking R-I
questions R-I
in R-I
class R-I
because R-I
they R-I
don R-I
' R-I
t R-I
want R-I
to R-I
look R-I
dumb R-I
. R-I

For R-I
a R-I
special R-I
education R-I
student R-I
, R-I
this R-I
is R-I
magnified R-I
tremendously R-I
. R-I

Second R-B
, R-I
special R-I
education R-I
students R-I
typically R-I
have R-I
some R-I
modifications R-I
or R-I
accommodations R-I
written R-I
in R-I
their R-I
Individualized R-I
Education R-I
Plan R-I
. R-I

Oftentimes R-I
, R-I
their R-I
plan R-I
allows R-I
them R-I
to R-I
use R-I
notes R-I
, R-I
a R-I
calculator R-I
and R-I
/ R-I
or R-I
textbooks R-I
on R-I
tests R-I
. R-I

This R-I
means R-I
that R-I
the R-I
students R-I
choose R-I
to R-I
take R-I
the R-I
test R-I
in R-I
class R-I
— R-I
and R-I
have R-I
attention R-I
drawn R-I
to R-I
them R-I
because R-I
they R-I
get R-I
special R-I
treatment R-I
in R-I
other R-I
students R-I
eyes R-I
— R-I
or R-I
they R-I
take R-I
their R-I
test R-I
in R-I
the R-I
testing R-I
center R-I
where R-I
they R-I
can R-I
have R-I
more R-I
privacy R-I
. R-I

In R-I
addition R-I
, R-I
special R-I
education R-I
students R-I
tend R-I
to R-I
need R-I
more R-I
one-on-one R-I
instruction R-I
without R-I
distractions R-I
. R-I

When R-I
classes R-I
are R-I
filled R-I
with R-I
36 R-I
to R-I
40 R-I
students R-I
per R-I
class R-I
, R-I
one-on-one R-I
instruction R-I
becomes R-I
impossible R-I
. R-I

Lastly R-B
, R-I
special R-I
education R-I
teachers R-I
catch R-I
on R-I
quickly R-I
which R-I
traditional R-I
teachers R-I
are R-I
going R-I
to R-I
take R-I
the R-I
time R-I
to R-I
help R-I
the R-I
kids R-I
on R-I
their R-I
case R-I
load R-I
. R-I

I R-I
have R-I
always R-I
taken R-I
time R-I
to R-I
help R-I
as R-I
many R-I
students R-I
as R-I
possible R-I
, R-I
both R-I
traditional R-I
and R-I
special R-I
education R-I
students R-I
. R-I

Special R-I
education R-I
teachers R-I
see R-I
this R-I
and R-I
place R-I
more R-I
students R-I
in R-I
my R-I
classes R-I
than R-I
in R-I
other R-I
math R-I
teachers R-I
' R-I
classes R-I
. R-I

I R-I
will R-I
have R-I
10 R-I
special R-I
education R-I
students R-I
in R-I
one R-I
class R-I
period R-I
, R-I
and R-I
another R-I
math R-I
teacher R-I
with R-I
the R-I
same R-I
class R-I
in R-I
the R-I
same R-I
period R-I
will R-I
have R-I
none R-I
. R-I

This R-I
puts R-I
a R-I
tremendous R-I
amount R-I
of R-I
pressure R-I
on R-I
me R-I
, R-I
as R-I
I R-I
want R-I
to R-I
help R-I
all R-I
of R-I
my R-I
students R-I
, R-I
but R-I
can R-I
' R-I
t R-I
provide R-I
the R-I
one-on-one R-I
time R-I
that R-I
my R-I
students R-I
need R-I
during R-I
class R-I
time R-I
. R-I

The O
point O
that O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
make O
here O
is O
that O
special O
education O
students O
already O
have O
a O
learning O
curve O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
we O
as O
teachers O
need O
to O
do O
everything O
we O
can O
to O
assist O
them O
. O

It O
breaks O
my O
heart O
when O
I O
hear O
about O
other O
teachers O
ridiculing O
these O
students O
in O
class O
or O
dismissing O
their O
needs O
. O

This O
is O
the O
reality O
of O
public O
education O
today O
. O

If O
teachers O
aren O
' O
t O
willing O
to O
step O
up O
to O
the O
challenge O
, O
they O
shouldn O
' O
t O
enter O

I C-B
have C-I
to C-I
say C-I
that C-I
I C-I
am C-I
very C-I
sympathetic C-I
to C-I
home C-I
educaters C-I
. C-I

I P-B
once P-I
read P-I
, P-I
admittedly P-I
in P-I
a P-I
pro-home-ed P-I
publication P-I
, P-I
that P-I
a P-I
child P-I
, P-I
if P-I
properly P-I
taught P-I
, P-I
can P-I
learn P-I
as P-I
much P-I
in P-I
two P-I
hours P-I
at P-I
home P-I
as P-I
a P-I
child P-I
could P-I
learn P-I
in P-I
an P-I
entire P-I
school P-I
day P-I
at P-I
a P-I
mainstream P-I
school P-I
. P-I

The O
child O
would O
then O
be O
free O
to O
pursue O
other O
valuable O
activities O
such O
as O
art O
, O
playing O

If O
done O
by O

with O
the O
right O
mindset O

levels O

I O
cannot O
see O
the O
problem O

OTOH P-B
, P-I
one P-I
does P-I
read P-I
and P-I
hear P-I
about P-I
people P-I
who P-I
withdraw P-I
children P-I
from P-I
school P-I
because P-I
they P-I
have P-I
some P-I
dispute P-I
with P-I
the P-I
school P-I
about P-I
discipline P-I
( P-I
school P-I
tries P-I
to P-I
, P-I
parents P-I
object P-I
) P-I
or P-I
because P-I
the P-I
school P-I
has P-I
failed P-I
to P-I
address P-I
bullying P-I
concerns P-I
. P-I

In R-B
those R-I
cases R-I
, R-I
children R-I
can R-I
end R-I
up R-I
being R-I
home-schooled R-I
by R-I
people R-I
who R-I
may R-I
not R-I

it R-I
. R-I

I R-B
can R-I
also R-I
see R-I
how R-I
child R-I
abusers R-I
could R-I
use R-I
home-schooling R-I
as R-I

Frankly O

the O
difference O
is O
in O
the O
parenting O
and O
input O
, O
not O
in O
the O
method O
of O

And O
the O
same O
goes O
for O
any O
child O
in O
any O
school O
, O
as O
any O

will O
tell O
you O
. O

The O
kids O
that O

are O
the O
ones O
with O

At O

I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
add O
that O
I O
personally O
, O
in O
many O
years O
in O
a O
very O
mixed O
comprehensive O
in O
Inner O
London O
, O
never O
took O
the O
blindest O
bit O
of O
notice O
of O
who O
was O
currently O
" O
failing O

as O
a O

, O
whether O
it O
be O
black O
, O
Asian O
, O
white O
boys O
, O

or O
bunny O
rabbits O
. O

I O
tended O
to O
teach O
the O
kids O
in O
my O
class O
as O
individuals O
. O

The O
one O
factor O
that O
I O
did O
notice O
made O
the O
biggest O
difference O
was O
, O
as O
mentioned O
above O
, O
parenting O
. O

If O
a O
teacher O
can O
call O
the O
parent O
and O
get O
backed O
up O
, O
and O
work O
with O
the O
parent O
, O
then O
the O
kid O
will O
do O
well O
and O
work O
through O
difficulties O
. O

Sadly O
, O
many O
parents O
seemed O
to O
regard O
school O
as O
a O
babysitter O
, O
not O
something O
to O
be O
worked O
with O
, O
and O
were O
all O
to O
ready O
to O
blame O
the O
teachers O
or O
school O
rather O
then O
themselves O
or O
the O
child O
. O

You O
really O
can O
' O
t O
expect O
a O
child O
to O
listen O
to O
a O
teacher O
telling O
them O
they O
can O
succeed O
, O
when O
their O
parents O
can O
' O
t O
be O
bothered O
to O
pick O
them O
up O
after O
a O
football O
match O
, O
or O
send O
them O
to O

dirty O
, O
unwashed O
. O

Or O
leave O
it O
to O
the O
teacher O
( O
me O
) O
to O
pick O
the O
kid O
up O
from O
a O
supermarket O
for O
shoplifting O
and O
sort O
it O
out O
, O
because O
they O
are O
watching O
the O
football O
. O

All O
this O
and O
more O
happened O
to O
me O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
some O

were O

It P-B
has P-I
been P-I
noted P-I
in P-I
the P-I
previous P-I
sections P-I
that P-I
single-sex P-I
education P-I
can P-I
provide P-I
a P-I
more P-I
structured P-I
learning P-I
environment P-I
for P-I
both P-I
boys P-I
and P-I
girls P-I
. P-I

I O
believe O
the O
far O
more O
important O
thing O
to O
consider O
in O
the O
single-sex O
vs O
. O
coeducational O
debate O
is O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
attitudes O
and O
emotions O
of O
the O
children O
involved O
are O
adversely O
or O
positively O
affected O
. O

“ O
Recently O
, O
various O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
boys O
are O
less O
motivated O
than O
girls O
and O
hold O
less O
positive O
attitudes O
towards O
school O
than O
girls O
( O
Van O
Houte O
, O
2004 O
) O
. O
” O

So O
maybe O
the O
debate O
really O
has O
no O
footing O
at O
all O
, O
maybe O
it O
is O
just O
inherent O
that O
boys O
do O
not O
like O
school O
as O
much O
as O
girls O
? O

In O
study O
conducted O
by O
Mieke O
Van O
Houte O
( O
2004 O
) O
he O
examined O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
presence O
of O
girls O
affected O
the O
achievement O
and O
behavior O
of O
boys O
. O

His P-B
argument P-I
was P-I
that P-I
because P-I
girls P-I
are P-I
more P-I
structured P-I
and P-I
academically P-I
oriented P-I
than P-I
boys P-I
that P-I
more P-I
girls P-I
in P-I
the P-I
classroom P-I
would P-I
give P-I
the P-I
boys P-I
more P-I
“ P-I
positive P-I
school P-I
behavior P-I
” P-I
to P-I
model P-I
. P-I

“ P-I
In P-I
general P-I
it P-I
is P-I
stated P-I
that P-I
girls P-I
spend P-I
more P-I
time P-I
doing P-I
homework P-I
, P-I
display P-I
less P-I
disturbing P-I
behaviour P-I
in P-I
the P-I
classroom P-I
and P-I
play P-I
truant P-I
less P-I
often P-I
. P-I

Boys P-I
take P-I
a P-I
more P-I
laid-back P-I
approach P-I
, P-I
work P-I
less P-I
hard P-I
, P-I
and P-I
are P-I
distracted P-I
more P-I
quickly P-I
. P-I

( P-I
Van P-I
Houte P-I
, P-I
2004 P-I
) P-I
” P-I
The P-I
study P-I
found P-I
that P-I
indeed P-I
the P-I
more P-I
girls P-I
that P-I
are P-I
in P-I
the P-I
classroom P-I
, P-I
the P-I
better P-I
the P-I
boys P-I
perform P-I
( P-I
Van P-I
Houte P-I
, P-I
2004 P-I
) P-I
, P-I
it P-I
also P-I
found P-I
out P-I
that P-I
it P-I
is P-I
not P-I
so P-I
much P-I
the P-I
mere P-I
presence P-I
of P-I
girls P-I
as P-I
it P-I
is P-I
the P-I
proportion P-I
of P-I
girls P-I
. P-I

In P-B
another P-I
study P-I
conducted P-I
by P-I
Salomone P-I
( P-I
2006 P-I
) P-I
she P-I
states P-I
“ P-I
There P-I
is P-I
some P-I
indication P-I
that P-I
single-sex P-I
classes P-I
may P-I
develop P-I
greater P-I
self-confidence P-I
and P-I
broader P-I
interests P-I
especially P-I
among P-I
adolescents P-I
… P-I
. P-I
girls P-I
report P-I
that P-I
they P-I
feel P-I
more P-I
comfortable P-I
… P-I
interact P-I
more P-I
with P-I
teachers P-I
… P-I
and P-I
develop P-I
more P-I
favorable P-I
attitudes P-I
towards P-I
these P-I
subjects P-I
( P-I
math P-I
and P-I
science P-I
) P-I
. P-I
” P-I

Salomone P-I
also P-I
states P-I
that P-I
single-sex P-I
schooling P-I
for P-I
promotes P-I
interest P-I
for P-I
boys P-I
in P-I
humanities P-I
courses P-I
and P-I
that P-I
boys P-I
’ P-I
feel P-I
more P-I
at P-I
ease P-I
because P-I
they P-I
do P-I
not P-I
feel P-I
societal P-I
pressures P-I
to P-I
be P-I
male P-I
. P-I

However P-B
, P-I
it P-I
should P-I
be P-I
made P-I
clear P-I
that P-I
coeducation P-I
can P-I
also P-I
foster P-I
good P-I
mental P-I
and P-I
emotional P-I
situations P-I
. P-I

As P-I
mentioned P-I
in P-I
a P-I
study P-I
by P-I
Mael P-I
( P-I
1998 P-I
) P-I
coeducation P-I
classrooms P-I
and P-I
schools P-I
reflect P-I
real P-I
life P-I
and P-I
prepare P-I
youths P-I
for P-I
gender P-I
interactions P-I
and P-I
society P-I
more P-I
so P-I
than P-I
a P-I
single-sex P-I
school P-I
would P-I
, P-I
it P-I
could P-I
also P-I
reduce P-I
sex P-I
stereotypes P-I
. P-I

Also P-I
, P-I
he P-I
states P-I
that P-I
some P-I
coeducational P-I
advocates P-I
view P-I
single-sex P-I
education P-I
for P-I
girls P-I
as P-I
emphasizing P-I
male P-I
dominant P-I
views P-I
like P-I
competitiveness P-I
and P-I
individuality P-I
which P-I
do P-I
not P-I
improve P-I
male-female P-I
equity P-I
( P-I
Mael P-I
, P-I
1998 P-I
) P-I
. P-I

Further P-B
in P-I
the P-I
study P-I
Mael P-I
highlights P-I
both P-I
the P-I
benefits P-I
for P-I
females P-I
and P-I
males P-I
to P-I
single-sex P-I
education P-I
he P-I
states P-I
that P-I
because P-I
coeducational P-I
schools P-I
foster P-I
obsession P-I
over P-I
hair P-I
and P-I
clothes P-I
and P-I
tend P-I
to P-I
make P-I
girls P-I
more P-I
silent P-I
that P-I
the P-I
single-sex P-I
education P-I
of P-I
girls P-I
is P-I
better P-I
for P-I
their P-I
mentality P-I
. P-I

In O
addition O
he O
adds O
that O
single-sex O
education O
for O
boys O
would O
allow O
adequate O
time O
for O
male O
maturation O
and O
would O
benefit O
the O
boys O
by O
giving O
them O
more O
structure O
and O
discipline O
due O
to O
their O
tendencies O
of O
restlessness O
and O
aggression O
( O
Mael O
, O
1998 O
) O
It O
seems O
clear O
that O
single-sex O
education O
advocates O
have O
done O
their O
research O
and O
that O
it O
does O
make O
sense O
that O
girls O
and O
boys O
being O
separated O
would O
foster O
an O
environment O
of O
non-stereotyping O
and O
encourage O
learning O
. O

Regina O
high O
school O
would O
benefit O
the O
most O
because O
their O
girls O
would O
have O
higher O
self-esteem O
and O
higher O
self-confidence O
in O
their O
learning O
abilities O
then O
they O
would O
at O
a O
coeducational O
school O
. O

De O
La O
Salle O
would O
have O
mixed O
results O
because O
although O
single-sex O
education O
does O
have O
its O
benefits O
to O
boys O
, O
there O
is O
no O
clear O
evidence O
that O
exists O
either O
way O
. O

If O
De O
La O
Salle O
had O
teachers O
capable O
of O
punishing O
students O
and O
keeping O
the O
boys O
on O
track O
while O
in O
school O
, O
then O
it O
would O
most O
likely O
be O
a O
benefit O
, O
if O
the O
staff O
lacks O
the O
ability O
to O
control O
the O
boys O
, O
it O
would O
be O
bad O
. O

St O
. O
Clair O
high O
school O
would O
once O
again O
have O
both O
good O
and O
bad O
consequences O
because O
boys O
would O
most O
likely O
do O
better O
because O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
girls O
, O
but O
girls O
would O
most O
likely O
do O
worse O
. O

It O
was O
previously O
mentioned O
in O
this O
project O
that O
coeducational O
schools O
need O
to O
adopt O
a O
non-stereotyping O
language O
and O
equal O
opportunity O
environment O
to O
foster O
equity O
and O
success O
between O
boys O
and O
girls O
. O

Until O
that O
is O
done O
boys O
will O
be O
boys O
and O
do O
succeed O
in O
the O
coeducation O
environment O
while O

the O
quality O

has O
shown O
a O
steady O
statistical O
decline O

Is O
there O
a O
link O
between O

two O
? O

Humanism O
assumes O
that O
the O
supernatural O
does O
not O
exist O
and O
that O
reality O
must O
be O
discovered O
purely O
from O
man O
' O

reasoning O
. O

Our O
public O
school O
system O
has O
been O
operating O
on O
this O
foundation O
since O
prayer O
was O
removed O
in O
1962 O
. O

Returning O
prayer O
to O
school O
would O
be O
an O
affront O
to O
this O
philosophy O
because O
prayer O
acknowledges O
the O
existence O
of O
someone O
greater O

man O

Allowing P-B
prayer P-I
in P-I
school P-I
sets P-I
an P-I
important P-I
standard P-I

It P-I
tells P-I
students P-I
that P-I
they P-I
are P-I
more P-I

just P-I
a P-I
collection P-I
of P-I

energy P-I
that P-I
happen P-I
to P-I
be P-I
occupying P-I
space P-I

Prayer P-B
is P-I
an P-I
action P-I
which P-I
proclaims P-I
that P-I
life P-I
is P-I
more P-I
than P-I
saving P-I
the P-I
environment P-I
or P-I
accumulating P-I
wealth P-I
. P-I

The O
fervency O
with O
which O
school O
prayer O
is O
opposed O
is O
not O
because O
the O
ACLU O
( O
an O
anti-Christian O
legal O
group O
) O
is O
trying O
to O
protect O
atheist O
from O
being O
indoctrinated O

It O

it O

the O
beliefs O
of O
those O
who O
set O
policy O
for O
much O
of O
our O
public O

Prayer O
is O
a O
frontal O
attack O
on O
the O
notion O
that O
mankind O
is O
in O
autonomous O
control O
of O
his O
own O
destiny O
and O
an O
insult O
to O
those O
who O
believe O
that O
friends O

A B-B

Most P-B
Americans P-I
are P-I
in P-I
favor P-I
of P-I
prayer P-I
in P-I

they P-I
realize P-I
that P-I
there P-I

something P-I

from P-I
the P-I
open P-I
acknowledgement P-I

there P-I
is P-I
no P-I
absolute P-I
basis P-I
for P-I
morals P-I
, P-I
and P-I
a P-I
free P-I
society P-I
drifts P-I
toward P-I
anarchy P-I

removed B-I
from B-I
public B-I
school B-I

One O

to O

that O

That O
means O
adults O

them O
develop O
negotiation O

to O
share O

“ O
Research O

that O

to O

In O
this O
fast-track O
world O

it O
may O

hard O

On O
the O
community O

Densmore O
encourages O
parents O
to O

an O
active O
role O

Parents O
should O
talk O
with O

Look O
for O

Challenge O
school O
committees O
to O
reconsider O
whether O
standardized O

the O
lower O

a O
good O
idea O

Pressure O
to O
prepare O

these O
tests O
starts O
as O
early O

No O

( O

to O

give O
him O

a O

using O
pictures O
or O
words O

depending O
on O

The O
idea O
that O
child O
abuse O
can O
be O
thwarted O
by O
tightening O
laws O
about O
home O
education O
has O
been O
around O
for O
some O
time O
. O

The O
tragic O
case O
of O
Khyra O
Ishaq O
prompted O
Ed O
Balls O
to O
commission O
a O
review O
of O
home O
education O
in O
2009 O
that O
was O
undertaken O
by O
Graham O
Badman O
. O

He O
reached O
the O
same O
conclusions O
as O
this O
week O
' O
s O
serious O
case O
review O
– O
that O
the O
law O
be O
changed O
to O
ensure O
that O
social O
services O
speak O
to O
children O
to O
assess O
if O
home O
education O
is O
in O
their O
interests O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
Khyra O
' O
s O
last O
hope O
was O
that O
the O
local O
authority O
' O
s O
home O
education O
support O
team O
might O
intervene O
once O
her O
mother O
had O
withdrawn O
her O
from O
school O
. O

The O
principle O
seems O
straightforward O
– O
through O
registration O
, O
all O
home-educated O
children O
would O
become O
visible O
to O
the O
authorities O
, O
who O
could O
then O
protect O
them O
– O
and O
ensure O
that O
the O
education O
being O
received O
is O
adequate O
. O

But O
Khyra O
was O
known O
to O
be O
at O
risk O
by O
the O
agencies O
whose O
job O
it O
was O
to O
protect O
her O
both O
before O
and O
after O
her O
withdrawal O
from O
school O
. O

The O
unpleasant O
fact O
is O
that O
parents O
who O
want O
to O
abuse O
children O
have O
ample O
opportunity O
wherever O
their O
children O
' O
s O
education O
is O
taking O
place O
. O

The O
belief O
that O
children O
in O
school O
or O
being O
monitored O
out O
of O
school O
cannot O
be O
suffering O
abuse O
is O
sadly O
naive O
. O

From O
the O
home O
educators O
' O
point O
of O
view O
, O
however O
, O
the O
conflating O
of O
welfare O
issues O
with O
education O
is O
a O
dangerous O
step O
. O

It O
not O
only O
threatens O
educational O
freedom O
but O
also O
places O
a O
presumption O
of O
guilt O
on O
loving O
families O
who O
must O
prove O
themselves O
innocent O
to O
suspicious O
officialdom O
. O

And O
, O
most O
insidious O
of O
all O
, O
if O
the O
law O
were O
changed O
, O
social O
workers O
and O
education O
professionals O
would O
presumably O
be O
expected O
to O
monitor O
the O
quality O
of O
education O
provided O
. O

It O
is O
here O
that O
home O
educators O
have O
their O
strongest O
reservations O

to P-I
the P-I

That O

the O

Evidence P-B
including P-I
our P-I
own P-I
suggests P-I
strongly P-I
that P-I
this P-I

of P-I

prepares P-I

enter P-I
further P-I

higher P-I

the P-I

failure O

grasp O

the O
ideas O

can O
underlie O

Even O
the O

this O
failure O

understanding O

Small O

This O

answerable O

a O

The O
idea O

The C-B

My P-B
personal P-I
experience P-I
with P-I
the P-I
public P-I

in P-I
many P-I

is P-I
that P-I
they P-I
teach P-I
to P-I
the P-I
lowest P-I
common P-I
denominator P-I
. P-I

The P-I
disruptive P-I
child P-I
gets P-I
more P-I
attention P-I
and P-I
takes P-I
away P-I

the P-I

the P-I
rest P-I

In P-I
the P-I
private P-I
school P-I
system P-I
, P-I
the P-I
administration P-I
is P-I
more P-I
able P-I

Most B-B
people B-I
who B-I

#IFTHEN O

It O

“ O
If O

then O
God O
hears O

forgives O

” O

To O
FFRF O

groups O
like O
it O
, O
the O
threat O
of O
prayer O
at O
school O
is O
the O
“ O
then O
. O
” O

The O
threat O
is O
that O
when O
students O
pray O
, O
then O
God O
responds O
. O

If O
prayer O
didn O
’ O
t O
work O
, O
then O
a O
group O
of O
students O
gathering O
around O
a O
flagpole O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
talk O
to O
God O
would O
pose O
no O
threat O
. O

If O
prayer O
didn O
’ O
t O
work O
, O
then O
FFRF O
would O
not O
find O
it O
“ O
unfortunate O
” O
that O

group P-I

students P-I
calling P-I
out P-I

God P-I

the P-I

this P-I

If P-B

it P-I

My P-B
experience P-I
in P-I
a P-I
secondary P-I
co-ed P-I
is P-I
that P-I
the P-I

situation P-I
does P-I
deflect P-I
some P-I
of P-I
this P-I
tension P-I

If P-I
the P-I
atmosphere P-I

right P-I
, P-I
if P-I
the P-I
pastoral P-I

excellent P-I

I P-I
feel P-I
that P-I
the P-I
co-ed P-I
environment P-I
creates P-I
a P-I
vibrant P-I

exciting P-I
